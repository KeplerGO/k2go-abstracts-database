# Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Program Abstracts Database

This repository contains:

* A CSV file detailing the abstracts of all observed K2 Guest Observer science
  programs (cf. `k2go-abstracts-database.csv`).
* A Python script which converts this database into ADS records (cf. `create-ads-abstracts.py`).

### Notes

* Campaigns 0, 1, 2, and 3 were unofficial i.e. unfunded Campaigns for which
the PI's did not submit abstracts. The 2-page proposals for these Campaigns can
be found in the git repository of the Kepler Science Website instead
([https://github.com/KeplerGO/KeplerScienceWebsite/tree/master/content/data/k2-programs](here)).
