# Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Program Abstracts Database

This repository contains:

* `k2go-abstracts-database.csv`: a CSV file detailing the abstracts of all observed K2 Guest Observer science
  programs.
* `create-ads-abstracts.py`: a Python script which converts the CSV file into ADS records.

### Notes

* The database only contains titles (not abstracts) for Campaigns 0, 1, 2, and 3.
These Campaigns were unfunded and the PI's did not submit abstracts.
Instead, 2-page proposals for these Campaigns can be found in the git repository
of the Kepler Science Website
([https://github.com/KeplerGO/KeplerScienceWebsite/tree/master/content/data/k2-programs](here)).
