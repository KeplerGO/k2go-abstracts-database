These planets may provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on a transiting exoplanet, thanks to the diminished contrast ratio between the Earth-sized WD and its Earth-sized planets. The James Webb Space Telescope is capable of obtaining the first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no known planets around WDs. Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability of the K2 mission to perform a transit survey that is capable of detecting the first planet in the habitable zone of a white dwarf. There are nearly 400 WDs known in Fields 4 and 5. Thanks to the large field of view of Kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of WDs can be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits. This survey will maintain Kepler's spirit of searching for habitable Earths, but near new hosts."

Time-series analysis techniques will be used to accomplish our goals. The high cadence choice is non-negotiable to discover the theoretically predicted pulsations, which would enable the precise characterization of the M dwarfs inner structure and age, the Holy Grail of M dwarfs. This proposal perfectly addresses some of the K2 Science Motivations: 1/ the characterization of the internal structure and fundamental properties of stars using the tools of asteroseismology and 2/ goes a step further in providing small planets around bright and small stars to facilitate precise follow-up; even if some of the targets are faint in the optical, CARMENES still will be capable of doing the follow-up, as the targets emit more flux in the nIR, resulting in a fruitful alliance between K2 mission and CARMENES."
GO4003,4,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Xue, Zhichao",Testing DA White Dwarf Variability:  Can They Be Standard Stars?,"Supernova cosmology is the primary means to measure Dark Energy and other cosmology problems, while the current limiting factor for precision cosmology is the accuracy of the photometric calibration.  Large efforts have been made worldwide to generate standard stars to better than 1%, with the best efforts going to using DA White Dwarfs as on-chip standards. The general bias is that non-binary DA WDs (away from the ZZ Ceti instability strip) should be extremely stable in their brightness, but this has never been tested to better than 1% or so over a broad range of time scales.  (Ground-based telescopes do not have the stability, while HST does not have the cadence to test for variability on most timescales.)  If DA WDs are stable to the 0.1% level or so, then they would make excellent standards for supernova cosmology.  But, if a substantial fraction of DA WDs are variable at more than the ~0.3% level, then this solution will not work as planned.  The original Kepler field had 11 non-binary DA WDs, and our analysis shows 3-out-of-11 have >0.44% RMS intrinsic variation with timescales from 0.5-5 days, while 5-out-of-11 have >0.23% RMS intrinsic variations.  With this small-number statistics, the use of white dwarfs as standards for supernova cosmology is dubious.  But the numbers from the original Kepler field are too small to support any conclusions that are far-reaching for the big projects. To get substantial statistics on white dwarf variability, we propose to observe the 6 DA WDs in Fields 4 and 5 of the K2 mission that are brighter than 16.5 mag.  (We will add further systems in later K2 fields.)  Our goal is to measure the variability of large numbers of DA WDs, to test whether they can be used as standard stars for supernova cosmology."
GO4004,4,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,,Short-Duration Flares on Mira Stars,"With the year-long pulsational periods for Mira stars, it came as a startling surprise when many groups found short-duration (minutes to days) flares with amplitudes 0.4-1.4 mag.  Even now, little is known about these Mira flares, mainly because they are rare and because the small number of prior light curves have poor-cadence, poor stability, and inadequate accuracy.  Theoretical ideas have no detail, mainly because the observations are poor, with typical proposed mechanisms relating to magnetic reconnection associated with big loops tied in to close-in planets.  This observational and theoretical stagnation can be uniquely broken with the K2 mission, where the multiple fields will cover many Mira stars, allowing for wonderful light curves with millimag accuracy and no gaps for ~75 days each.  So I am proposing to observe 4 Miras in Field 4 and 3 Miras in Field 5.  The millimag accuracy in the K2 light curves will allow for the discovery of the presumably more-frequent flares of low amplitude.  The main data analysis will be the identification of short flares, and the measurement of their properties (duration, amplitude, energy, light curve shape, and phase in the Mira cycle).  These products will be used to create demographic results, like flare frequency/size/duration as a function of Mira type, period, and phase.  The K2 mission, and only the K2 mission, can turn the field from data-starved to data-rich.  Finally, the theorists will have something that they can work with."

These deep transits also increase the potential for subsequent atmospheric characterization. The extended Kepler K2 mission provides the opportunity to monitor nearby, M dwarfs with precise photometry and discover a new population of small planets; including rocky and potentially habitable planets and sub-Neptunes with large atmospheres. We propose to observe more than 9000 M dwarfs in the K2 campaign 4 and 5 fields to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate ~100 small planets around the M dwarfs in fields 4 and 5 and ~400 from the full K2-MDP program. This new population of planets will drastically increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems, improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected from the SUPERBLINK proper-motion database and Pan-STARRS 1 catalog on the basis of proper-motion, photometric colors, and SED fitting. This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs within 100pc of the Sun with little contamination. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date.  The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims to exploit the strengths of the K2 mission design to reveal hundreds of small planets around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-like planets and planets suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky planets and key, well characterized, spectroscopy targets for early JWST GTO and Cycle 1 proposals months prior to the launch of TESS."

The first phase of the KSwAGS uncovered 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., in preparation). Approximately half of these sources were indeed active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various type (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring M-stars).  High-precision optical follow-up would have been scientifically useful on all newly-discovered X-ray targets, however the fourth Kepler reaction wheel failed before we could propose monitoring of these sources.  All existing archived AGN light curves in the Kepler database were thus selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012). These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 108 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum is dominated by starlight, instead of AGN light. Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be constrained by a 75-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks. This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk).  Swift will begin surveying the K2 Campaign 4 FOV in 2014 Sept. We anticipate ~50 sources from this survey, based on the original KSwAGS, which discovered 93. The photometric precision and high duty cycle of K2 will be more than adequate for our purposes. Our objectives cannot be met using archival Kepler data because these AGN targets were selected with techniques that are biased toward high MBH objects."

The pulsation in HD 24355 was detected using the SuperWASP instrument and was found to have a period of 6.4 minutes and an amplitude of 1.65 millimagnitudes. We also detect a 14 day modulation in the lightcurve, representative of the rotation period of the star. SC observations are necessary to analyse this high frequency pulsator as the signature is well above the nominal Nyquist frequency of the Long Cadence mode.  SC observations will allow us to monitor the pulsation for frequency variability, a feature seen in two of the five previous Kepler roAp stars, as well as allowing us to determine if there are other pulsation modes below the ground-based detection limits. Finally, we aim to build on the results of the analysis of the roAp star KIC 10195926 and search for evidence for multiple pulsation axes in this roAp star.

To achieve our goals, we will conduct thorough data reduction of the provided data, aiming to maximise the output to best fit our science goals. Pulsational analysis will make use of linear and non-linear least squares fitting to the extracted lightcurve. The data will be sub-divided to monitor frequency and amplitude variations over the observing period.

Detailed analysis of this classical, high-amplitude, milli-magnitude, roAp star will be compared to those carried-out on the previous low-amplitude, micro-magnitude, roAp stars observed in the original Kepler mission, with the aim of determining if there are fundamental differences between the high and low amplitude roAp stars."

As a result, we have little information on the evolution of the magnetic field of main sequences stars in this final stage of evolution except for those with anomalously strong fields. This program will use very sensitive photometric observations of white dwarfs by Kepler/K2 to search for rotational modulation of the flux from low-magnetic field white dwarf stars caused by magnetic phenomena (such as starspots and plages).   On the expected white dwarf rotation periods (about 1 day, generalizing from nonradially pulsating white dwarfs), the low amplitude of the expected variations renders them extremely difficult to detect using ground-based photometry. K2 will be able to observe many well-studied field white dwarfs and many in the Pleiades, Hyades, and M44. Measurement of rotation modulation (or even upper limits to photometric amplitude variations)  will further exploit those data to teach us about magnetic fields in these stars that are otherwise inaccessible observationally.  In the case of ZZ Ceti pulsators, we may for the first time independently measure the rotation rate, providing a test of asteroseismic rotation periods."

Success will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the source of its chemical evolution. This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we currently have achieved mainly for the solar neighborhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology _x005F_x005F better known as Galactic Archaeology _x005F_x005F has used Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismic-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.

AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number (about 5,000 per campaign) of colour-magnitude selected red giants to probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighborhood. This is a continuing program initiated during Campaign-0, and it is our intention to make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before, taking advantage of K2_x005F_x005Fs _x005F_x005F360-degree view_x005F_x005F along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxy_x005F_x005Fs structure and evolution from its stellar populations.

METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by ground-based spectroscopy and photometry from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, RAVE, and SAGA). We will use our seismic inferred stellar properties to stress-test state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."

Instead, Doppler tomography (where we spectroscopically resolve the distortions in the spectral line shape during the transit of a planet around a rapidly rotating star) and analysis of the orbital phase curve (where we detect the combined effects of Doppler beaming and ellipsoidal variations of the host star and reflected light from the planet) can be used to validate planet candidates around these stars. We propose to use K2 to search for transiting planet candidates around a sample of main sequence A and early F stars in order to expand the sample of known planets around these stars and enable statistical investigations of this largely unexplored population; we will then validate the resulting planet candidates using Doppler tomography and phase curve analysis. Doppler tomography also allows the measurement of the (mis)alignment between the stellar spin and the planetary orbital plane, an important parameter for investigating planetary migration processes. This investigation will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population, planet formation, and planet migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."""

This will allow for calibrating the rotation_x005F_x005Fage relationship for main-sequence stars older than ~1 Gyr for the first time. Such rotation-based ages are precise to ~10%, which exceeds any other current method of determining ages of stars in the Galactic field. We will expand on our ongoing work to characterize and quantify the limitations of both Kepler and K2 data.

Based on the underlying premise that stars are born with an initial distribution of rotation periods and slow down over time as they shed angular momentum, Barnes et al. have have suggested an empirical framework for measuring stellar ages from their rotation periods. This paradigm, gyrochronology, works well for solar-type stars in young clusters and, apart from asteroseismology, is the most precise way to measure stellar ages of individual stars. Binary (or multiple) star systems are essentially small open clusters, albeit with just two members. While not able to provide the statistical power of the dozens of stars typical in an open cluster, an ensemble of binary systems in the Galactic field can be even more powerful as they span a range of ages, metallicities, and evolutionary histories that provide a truly heterogeneous population. Past the age of <1 Gyr, binaries are also much closer and brighter than open clusters. As all but the most massive open clusters, which are further away and fainter, become unbound after <1 Gyr, their utility is limited as lower-MS dwarfs tend to escape first, limiting their availability as age benchmarks. Lastly, components of wide binaries with semi-major axes s500 AU are coeval and evolve independently with no discernible effect on each other. Therefore, to test and calibrate gyrochronology for older stars, binary and multiple systems represent powerful keystones."

The transit of a planet, combined with radial velocity measurements, provides the mass and the radius of the planet, the planetary brightness temperature, the planetary day-night difference, and absorption features of the planetary upper-atmosphere constituents like sodium, hydrogen, water, and methane.

In our current knowledge of the Earth, little is known about its evolution during the first hundreds of million years. It is important to understand the evolution of exoplanets with time to provide key information in the early history and composition of our planet. This work aims at addressing important aspects such as (1) the frequency of planets in clusters, (2) the evolution of planet interiors as a function of age, and (3) planet formation models and the effect of migration. To address these questions, we plan to take advantage of the Kepler K2 mission that will monitor several nearby clusters/regions with a wide range of age for 70--80 days continuously during campaigns 4 and 5: rho Oph (~1 Myr), Upper Scorpius (5-10 Myr), the Pleiades (125 Myr), Praesepe (590 Myr), and the Hyades (625 Myr). The main advantage of cluster members is that they are born in the same cloud at the time under the same environment. Hence, they represent ideal targets to look at the formation and structure of planetary systems and the evolution with time of the composition and atmosphere of exoplanets. We will be sensitive to short period super-Earths and larger planets around well-characterised young solar-type star and M dwarf members. If the current empirical frequency of planets hold at young ages, we expect to discovery at least one super-Earth per cluster. The frequency of planets at young ages is currently unknown and only 2.8% of the hundreds of the planet-host stars known to date are younger than 600 Myr.

Our team will focus on the Pleiades, Praesepe, and Hyades where we identified bona-fide cluster members photometrically and astrometrically in an homogeneous manner using the near-infrared survey conducted by the UKIDSS Galactic Clusters Survey. We have already obtained optical spectra for a large number of member candidates with a battery of telescopes and instruments. We have also obtained high-resolution lucky-imaging data for more than 500 high-mass and low-mass members of the Pleiades and Praesepe, which will be combined with other works conducted in the Hyades. Hence, we know the level of activity, spectral type, temperature, and multiplicity properties of our target stars.

We compiled the most up-to-date list of high-mass and low-mass members in the Pleiades, Praesepe, and Hyades clusters with a wide range of spectral types and magnitudes using the catalogues of Stauffer et al. (2007, ApJS, 172, 663), Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007, AJ, 134, 2340), and Goldman et al. (2013, A&A, 559, 43) complemented by our latest studies."

The field-of-view of these campaigns covers the three open clusters Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe, the only main-sequence clusters in the Kepler-2 fields for which VLM cluster members can be monitored with sufficient precision to measure rotation periods. At ages of 100 and 600 Myr, the Pleiades and the Hyades are the ideal targets to constrain spindown models. In contrast to solar-mass stars, the spindown of VLM objects, especially in the substellar domain, is very poorly understood, particularly due to a lack of empirical constraints.  Kepler-2 will help us to remedy this situation. We expect to derive hundreds of VLM periods, an improvement by a factor of ~4 compared with the existing literature. This will enable us to derive the spindown timescales for VLM objects as a function of mass and to provide critical constraints for wind models in this mass domain. The lightcurves will be useful for a variety of secondary science projects, including the search for benchmark eclipsing binaries and for the first close-in planets around brown dwarfs."

This will enable us to perform a comparative study between the aperiodic variability properties of dwarf nova versus nova-like cataclysmic variables, and determine whether previously reported differences are consistently found within other systems.

These will be used to test the predictions of stellar theory, confirm the resolution of the Pleiades distance discrepancy, and measure the helium abundance of the cluster.

Although astronomers have measured the radii of many of these worlds to impressive precision by combining photometry with detailed characterization of planet host stars, the masses of the vast majority of small planets are completely unconstrained. There are only seven planets smaller than 2.5 Earth radii with published mass uncertainties smaller than 20%, the minimum value required to begin to discriminate between models of planet composition.  Our K2 Campaign 4 and 5 proposal is designed to significantly advance our understanding of the compositional diversity of small planets by tripling the number of small planets with well-constrained masses and radii. We propose to observe 8692 moderately bright stars with K2 to search for transiting planets. Based on occurrence rates measured using prime Kepler mission results, we anticipate that 64 +/- 8 small, short-period planets will transit our proposed stars during the campaigns and that 35 +/- 6 of those planets will be detectable by K2. We will search for those planets in the K2 pixel data using the light curve processing and planet detection pipeline developed by J. Johnson and A. Vanderburg.  After performing an initial round of vetting tests based on the K2 photometry, we will acquire reconnaissance spectroscopy and imaging of promising planet candidates to identify the best targets for high-precision radial velocity (HPRV) observations. We anticipate conducting reconnaissance observations for 28 +/- 5 planet candidates and selecting 14 +/- 4 targets for HPRV observations.

We will conduct our HPRV observations using the HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain. HARPS-N is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 40 nights per year of guaranteed time specifically devoted to observations of small planets detected by Kepler and K2. PI D. Charbonneau is chair of the HARPS-N Science Team and the HARPS-N Target Selection Tiger Team.

We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves, reconnaissance imaging, and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet  candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N.

Our campaign to measure the masses of 14 +/- 4 small K2 planets with precision higher than 15% will have a tremendous impact on our understanding of small planets. By trebling the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful background information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."

This fast rotation makes the stars magnetically active, and they show large spots and bright calcium emission lines.  RS CVn stars also have large amplitude flares, with brightening up to 1.6 mag, emissions from X-ray to radio, and durations from an hour to a bit over a day.  These 'superflares' have energies up to 10^38 erg.  This is an astounding amount of energy, and impossible to explain with any normal solar-flare-like model.  Theoretical ideas all center on reconnection of magnetic fields in coronal loops, but the loops must be large and the fields strong, and this can only be done by involving the fields between the two binary star components.  But the field configurations and the detailed microphysics are not known.  RS CVn superflares have adequate observations from X-ray to optical to radio for a relatively small number of events.  But what is missing, that K2 can uniquely provide, is long coverage of many RS CVn systems to provide good and unbiased demographics, as well as the great sensitivity needed to confidently detect small amplitude events.  Kepler has not looked at any RS CVn systems previously, so we are proposing to use K2 to target 34 RS CVns in Fields 4 and 5.  With this, we will be able to push the detectable flare amplitude down by two orders-of-magnitude and our long coverage will be able to push to the largest amplitude superflares.  The great statistics from K2 will be able to perform tests like measuring the orbital phase dependence of flare frequency so as to distinguish between the magnetic loop and the magnetospheric tail reconnection models.

	RS CVn superflares fit into a larger picture of superflares on Sun-like stars, with these other superflares having similar observational properties, yet their parent stars have no apparent companions.  One likely model for superflares on Sun-like stars is the same as we describe for RS CVn flares, except that the cool star is replaced by a close-in planet as the place to anchor the magnetic loops.  A goal of this K2 proposal is to test how similar are the two types of superflares.  For example, we will test whether the size-frequency distributions are the same, with a further comparison to Solar flares.  Only K2 can do this."

We can retrieve more information from the study of stars that belong to open clusters than from isolated stars. The key assumption is that, because they have a common origin, these stars have the same characteristics and we can do an isochronal fit to estimate different parameters like age, distance or metalicity. These quantities can then be related to the oscillations observed in each one of these stars.

Stars in close binary systems undergo different evolutionary scenario from single stars of similar mass, due to tidal interactions between stellar components. Thus, we get the opportunity to evaluate and further develop the tidal theory by studying close binary systems. Dynamical tidal forces in binary systems may lead to a resonant excitation of stellar pulsations in individual binary components. These tidally-induced oscillations provide a potential of probing deep stellar interiors, but the topic is currently not well explored observationally.

Recent investigations showed that present-day single-star evolutionary models are inadequate and lack a serious amount of near-core mixing when applied to binary stars. A large sample of pulsating binaries with precise masses is required to draw any firm conclusions. So far, for about a hundred of massive binaries only, the masses were derived to the required precision, and the current sample is greatly biased towards short orbital period binaries. With K2, we aim at observing about 100 members of the class of massive binary stars, which will lead to significant extension of the sample, in particular towards longer orbital periods. The key questions to be addressed in our research are: is it feasible to use the core overshoot parameter alone in an attempt to solve the mass discrepancy problem in massive binary systems? What is the role of tidally-induced pulsations in the evolution of angular momentum within a binary system? What are the key mechanisms and type of interactions that are responsible for the discrepancy between the observations and tidal evolution theory?"

Although we have a general concept of how stars are formed and evolve, our current knowledge of early stellar evolution is limited and contains a lot of unsolved questions such as the determination of pre-MS lifetimes and ages, and the speed of early stellar evolution. Young intermediate-mass stars with ~1 to 6 solar masses have similar atmospheric properties to their evolved counterparts in the (post-)main sequence phase. Hence, it is not possible to constrain the evolutionary stage of a given star by its atmospheric properties (i.e., effective temperature, surface gravity and luminosity) alone. As pre-MS stars differ from their more evolved analogues of same atmospheric properties mostly in their interiors, asteroseismology provides an independent method to constrain the evolutionary stage of a field star. It also allows investigating the relevance of various physical processes to early stellar evolution. An example for the enormous potential of the application of asteroseismic methods to pre-MS stars is described in our recent study (Zwintz et al. 2014, Science, 345, 550) where we revealed a first connection between the oscillation properties of pre-MS stars and their relative stage in the pre-MS evolution.

Here we propose to observe 10 previously identified intermediate mass pre-MS stars in fields 4 and 5 that lie in the effective temperature range between ~15 000K (spectral type B5) and ~6500K (spectral type F5) to search for SPB, delta Scuti and gamma Doradus type pulsations."

Their peculiarities are thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration. Stars need to be rotating slower than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 2_x005F_x005F10 days.

Recent studies have found that a significant fraction of Am stars have low-level pulsations, which is at odds with the need for stability to produce the chemical peculiarities. In addition there is increasing evidence for planets orbiting around A-type stars.

Using K2 we will collect a statistically-significant sample of  Am stars, in order to: 1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binarity within the Am stars, 3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars.

We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary.

In conclusion, the K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's stars, a local halo M subdwarf, the stars of the Galactic halo population are now known to harbor exoplanets as well as those of the Galactic disk. However, very little is currently known about the prevalence and properties of the exoplanets in the halo. Our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed in campaigns 4-5 of the Kepler K2 mission have identified 1,957 high-velocity subdwarfs that are nearby members of the Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, to identify and characterize a statistically significant number of the first generation of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars."

Many sdBs are known to have close companions with periods ranging from 0.05 to 10 days, and must have evolved through the common-envelope-ejection (CEE) process. The closest systems are quite easy to study from the ground, but Kepler observations have opened the door for precise studies of the population of systems with periods between 0.5 and and 10 days.

Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission. The excellent Kepler light curves show photometric signals from Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal deformations and mutual irradiation effects. Long-cadence K2 observations presents us with an unique opportunity to accumulate a larger sample of post-common envelope sdB binaries that can shed light on the statistics of the CEE process, and thereby constrain the long sought after efficiency parameters that govern the common envelope stage of evolution. In the process we hope to find new particularly interesting binary systems, such as the eclipsing cases and those with extraordinary masses that could be progenitors of type-Ia supernovae."

The initial Kepler field contained very few (only 4) distant and/or old clusters. The stellar content and cluster properties of nearby open clusters has already been well characterized from ground-based and some space-based multicolour photometric and spectroscopic observations. Here we propose to discover and characterize stellar variability in about 2700 probable cluster members of the four nearby open clusters accessible in Kepler 2 Fields 4 and 5: The Pleiades and Hyades (Field 4) and Praesepe and M67 (Field 5). Our primary goal is discover and refine the pulsation properties of mid and upper main-sequence variables (gamma Doradus, delta Scuti, and slowly pulsating B stars) having periods of hours to days accessible by long-cadence observations. Asteroseismology for these objects to date is limited by the number of modes observable from the ground and 1 c/d aliasing problems, difficulty in obtaining spectroscopic or photometric mode ID for the fainter variables that have been discovered/observed by Kepler, uncertainties in interior and initial abundances, especially for stars with abundance anomalies, uncertainties in distance/luminosity, and lack of knowledge of prior evolution history. We also target blue stragglers, A-F type stars with peculiar abundances that may or may not show pulsations, stars on the lower main sequence that may show variability due to rotating star spots or magnetic activity, binaries that may have one or more pulsating components. The constraints of common age, distance and initial abundances in clusters will place these stars in their evolutionary context, and help unlock some of the science questions and reduce uncertainties for understanding star formation and stellar evolution."

GO4050,4,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transits,"Although only 2% of stars evolve through the subdwarf B (sdB) phase (e.g. Heber 2009 ARA&A 47, 211 and refs. therein), there are at least two good reasons to study sdB planets/BDs: i) to date very little is known on the late-stage evolution of planetary systems. No detections yet around single white dwarfs (e.g. Hogan et al. 2009, MNRAS 396, 2074). Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and AGB (Villaver & Livio 2009, ApJ 705, L81; Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ, 761, 121; Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). Observational constraints are essential to test the models. SdB planets offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion and PN ejection).

ii) The envelope ejection needed to form an sdB star is well explained in terms of close binary evolution for half of the sdBs that have a close stellar companion (Han et al. 2002, MNRAS 336, 449; 2003, MNRAS 341, 669), but is more problematic for the other half of apparently single sdB stars. The presence of close massive planets or BDs is a possible explanation (Soker 1998,AJ 116, 1308; Han et al. 2012, PASP Conf. Series 452, 3).

In the last 7 years the first planet/BD candidates around sdB stars were detected (Silvotti et al. 2014, ASP Conf. Series 481, 13).

In particular, during its primary mission (K1), Kepler has detected two planetary systems around KIC05807616 (Charpinet et al. 2011, Nature 480, 496) and KIC10001893 (Silvotti et al. 2014, A&A in press) from illumination photometric variations, i.e. reflection/re-emission of the stellar light.

These planets (or planetary remnants) have Earth-like radii and are in very tight orbits. Previously they must have been engulfed by the RG envelope of the sdB precursor. Based on these discoveries, from statistical considerations it comes out that 1 out of ~40 single sdB stars is expected to show a planetary transit.

A similar number (1 out of ~25) is obtained independently from a small sample of 27 bright single-lined sdB stars showing small RV variations, that can be associated with massive sub-stellar companions (Geier et al. 2012, ASP Conf. Series, 452, 153).

The main goal of this proposal is to detect first sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targeting in SC ~40-50 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. SC is required as the typical transit duration of a close planet with 6h<P_orb<24h is 15 to 40 min. The transit depth varies between a 25% occultation for a Jovian planet down to 0.2% for Earth-like planets (assuming a typical sdB radius of 0.2 R_Sun). Given the high number of transits in a ~75 days run, K2 should be able to measure objects with a radius smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, in 1-3 years from now PEPSI@LBT and EXPRESSO@VLT may be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.

The secondary goal of this proposal is to find more Jovian/BD companions to sdB stars in tight orbits through illumination effects and increase the statistics of these objects. With ~2.5 months of data companions with Jovian radii are easily detectable. This secondary goal is compatible with LC data. LC data will also allow to increase the statistics of sdB faint stellar companions (WD or M-dwarf) through reflection/re-emission, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting; and to find new g-mode sdB pulsators and study them through asteroseismology."

In particular, radial velocity surveys such as those executed by HARPS and HIRES yield the planetary mass, assuming the host star is well-characterized. However, radial velocity surveys are inefficient, as they require relatively large amounts of large telescope time, and instruments observe only one star at a time. Proper target selection is therefore critical to maximize the probability of success. Typically search programs focus on relatively bright (V < 12) mid-G to early M dwarfs, excluding known active stars and spectroscopic binaries. This proposal takes advantage of the capabilities of K2 to greatly improve target selection and the resulting exoplanet detection rate, through the use of a technique which allows us to preferentially select systems with large values of sini based on photometry alone.  We propose to observe all lower main sequence stars (Teff = 2700-6500 K ) with V < 12 in both K2 fields 4 and 5. This amounts to approximately 4000 targets in each field. Our expected scientific outcomes are: 1. Identification of the best targets in these K2 fields for future planet searches.
2. Improved data on stellar rotation and activity as functions of metallicity and other fundamental parameters for our target stars. The use of different fields than the original Kepler FOV will enable sampling new portions of the stellar population of the Galaxy.
3. Detection of short-period (P < 20 d ) planets around our targets."

Such stars are overrepresented among the host stars of planets, especially those small planets with moderate equilibrium temperatures,  detected by the Kepler mission.  However, the possible dynamical and physical evolution of planets in the compact habitable zones around M dwarfs is poorly understood.  Because such stars evolve slowly after reaching the main sequence, it is difficult to assign ages to M dwarf planet systems and investigate changes with time.  M dwarfs in coeval moving groups of known age can be studied, and the rotation and activity of those stars used to construct a gyrochronology to assign ages to other M dwarfs in the field.    We propose K2 observations of 2121 M dwarf stars in the Campaign 4 and 5 fields that are confirmed or candidate members of the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe clusters.  The members of these clusters have ages of about 120, 650, and 600 Myr, respectively.  We include candidates in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog identified as M dwarfs in the recent published literature, as well as stars with matching colors and magnitudes, and proper motions permissive of the stars being dwarfs.  We propose long cadence observations to identify candidate transiting planets on short-period orbits and determine the stellar rotational periods in the resulting light curves.  We will carry out a vigorous campaign of ground-based observations to estimate the fundamental stellar parameters (effective temperature, metallicity, radius, luminosity, and mass) of these stars and use comparisons with a stellar evolution model, and estimates of distance, age, and radial velocity to assess the likelihood of membership of each star in any of the clusters.  We will use archival ultraviolet and X-ray observations from space mission to determine the high-energy radiation from these stars, and propose additional X-ray observations if appropriate.  We will use the rotation periods of these stars as obtained by K2 to construct an improved M dwarf gyrochronology with which we can assign ages to other, field M dwarfs and expand an investigation of the evolution of these stars and their planetary systems with time."

Their weak or completely absent discrete spectral  features leaves us with only continuum variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F4 and F5 field of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of blazars with Kep magnitude < 17 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip that are not previously identified blazars. The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density (PSD) on timescales from minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to extend the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies."

For these binary stars, we find a striking deficiency of planets; none of these binary stars has a planet candidate. With K2 mission, we propose to observe more known binary stars to confirm the deficiency. We consider only S-type circumstellar planet system, in which a planet orbits one of the binary stars, NOT circumbinary planets (P-type).

Our sample consists of 1100 binary stars, which represents the largest sample of binary stars for planet search. This sample will put a strong constraint on the planet occurrence rate in binary stars, which we denote as f. We calculate f for different number of planet detections. Non-detection will give a 3-sigma upper limit of f at 9.5%, which confirms the deficiency and the suppressive influence of a stellar companion on planet formation. One or two detections will confirm the deficiency at 2-3 sigma level. More than two detections are deemed as unlikely given the Kepler main mission result.  Targeting binary stars with no prior information of planet helps to unambiguously address the planet occurrence rate in binary stars. Increasing the sample size helps not only to confirm the deficiency of planets in binary stars but also study the influence of stellar companions on planets with different sizes and orbital separations. Future NASA mission in search of habitable worlds will inevitably encounter with this question: to select binary stars or not, which account for 33% of stars in the solar neighborhood.

At the same time, they are powerful standard candles for extragalactic and cosmological studies. They are key tools for stellar astrophysics for exploring connections between pulsation, mass loss, convection and rotation, as well as tracers of stellar populations and clusters. In the next decade, Cepheids will be employed to measure the Hubble constant to a precision of 1% using the James Webb Space Telescope, WFIRST and GAIA. To achieve these goals, uninterrupted, high-precision photometric measurements of Cepheids with the Kepler space telescope will be crucial, in order to understand the details of their light variations.

Cepheids are rare beasts in the Galaxy. So far, very few members were observed by space photometric missions: the original Kepler field, for example contained a single Type I star only. Observing every known and candidate Cepheids in the K2 mission will greatly enhance our understanding of these important stars. Our research goals include the understanding of period jitter and its connection to stellar evolution and pulsation, and to probe the effects of convection and granulation on Cepheid light curves. Observing the smaller, older Type II Cepheids will help us to gain insight into the formation theories of these stars. Field stars will also allow for a unique opportunity to compare their K2 light curves with extragalactic Cepheids that will be potentially observable in future K2 Fields. In order to meet these goals, a systematic survey of all known and suspected Cepheids in all K2 fields is required.

We identified eight Cepheid candidates in Field 4 and four in Field 5 of the K2 mission. Most of these stars are rather unknown, small-amplitude variable stars, promising to explore the limits of radial pulsation and test whether the previously-detected period jitter is ubiquitous, and if it is a result of surface convection or pulsation instabilities. We propose to observe all stars in long-candence mode.

Variability is often caused by magnetic activity and, as such, it has an apparently stochastic nature. This is why the impact of activity on photometry or radial velocities is often referred to as _x005F_x005Fjitter_x005F_x005F and treated as a noise source. But this approach is just a consequence of our lack of knowledge of how stellar magnetic activity works. If understood in sufficient detail, one could turn the supposed _x005F_x005Fnoise_x005F_x005F into _x005F_x005Fsignal_x005F_x005F and therefore correct it out. A particularly interesting possibility is to use simultaneous photometry and precision radial velocities to break some of the degeneracy and better constrain the reconstruction of the stellar surface, as well as studying parameter correlations. This was put to practice for the active planet host star HD 189733 with relatively good success but also highlighting the need to expand the test to other stars with extended time baselines and coverage density. K2 long-cadence photometry, in simultaneous combination with radial velocities from the ground, offers a unique opportunity to contribute critical information to the better modelling of stellar activity and subsequent correction of precise photometry and RVs for exoplanet discovery and measurement.

Our strategy comprises the selection of stars with moderate activity level in the K2 fields. Field 4 is particularly interesting since it covers part of the Hyades cluster, whose GK member stars are relatively bright and have the appropriate activity levels. Using several criteria we have selected V=7.5-8.5 mag G-type stars with log R_x005F_x005FHK around -4.5 in Field 4 and Field 5. The precise photometry from K2 will be complemented with ground-based RVs from the HARPS-N, TRES, and SOPHIE instruments to which the proposers have direct access and deliver measurements with precisions better than a few m/s. This will allow us to obtain simultaneous RV measurements for the targets, at a rate of one measurement per night, and for a time baseline of about 40-50 days. This represents several rotation cycles of the targets as they are expected to rotate with periods of ~10 days. The combination of K2 data and ground-based RV measurements is key to further our understanding of stellar activity and to turning a _x005F_x005Fnoise_x005F_x005F component into correctable _x005F_x005Fsignal_x005F_x005F, thus opening the way for the discovery of smaller exoplanets (using both photometry and spectroscopy) and for the eventual measurement of the minute signature of their atmospheres. Combining precise ground-based spectroscopy and space-based photometry of bright stars will be commonplace in the near future with the TESS mission.

These objects are excellent galactic structure tracers and distance indicators, therefore understanding their dynamics _x005F_x005F and their optical behavior _x005F_x005F is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. We plan to study 87 and 90 RR Lyrae stars in the Fields 4&5 with K2's unique capabilities of providing long, uninterrupted, high-precision space photometry. The sample will be used to conduct galactic structure studies and to improve our understanding of dynamical behavior of RR Lyrae stars. Our immediate objectives are: 1. Study the Galactic structure and history by obtaining distances to RR Lyrae stars and determine their spatial distribution (halo streams, over-densities). During the K2 Mission we will build up a unique database from field to field covering different parts of our Galaxy, to yield an unprecedented photometric RR Lyrae sample which will form the base of galactic structure studies and near-field cosmology. 2. Statistical analysis of various dynamical phenomena (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko-modulation, period-doubling, low-dimensional chaos, nonradial modes) and their occurrence rates to better understand their origin and their effect on distance determination. This can only be accomplished with K2. 3. Analyze in detail all RR Lyrae light curves, especially overtone and classical double-mode pulsators. The original Kepler field contained no RRd stars, and only a few RRc. This will aid the investigation of dynamical phenomena (resonances, mode interactions) that may be important in other types of pulsating stars, but can be best studied only in large-amplitude stars and with space photometry. After producing light curves from target pixel data we apply standard time-frequency analysis and study  time-dependent features. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes and ground-based follow-up observations will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models  will be computed to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations. The proposed project will provide a unique opportunity to better understand these highly variable classical pulsating stars on the horizontal branch and their role in unraveling the formation of our Galaxy."
GO4071,4,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,,Monitoring Targets Within 100 Light Years,"Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 light years provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres.  A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets.  It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come.  I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 light years (or 30.7 pc).  The sample is expected to be less than 30 targets, and they may be observed with the long cadence.  While the probability of a detection of a planet in such a small sample is low, given the total sample in all K2 campaigns, it is favorable that such a nearby planetary system will be detected.  If so, it is likely to be one of the most heavily scrutinized systems given the relative ease of follow-up observations.  This not only applies to the planetary properties (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements, astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements), but also the stellar properties (e.g., metallicity, activity, wind strength), and even the circumstellar (e.g., debris disk, exozodical emission) and surrounding interstellar properties.  For example, stellar winds are critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres, even when they are relatively weak, like those of solar-like stars.  The only method of measuring such winds is through the interaction of the interstellar medium and the stellar wind, which creates an astrosphere.  This requires some knowledge of the surrounding interstellar medium and stellar properties, and has only been successful for very nearby stars.  Therefore, given its proximity, a planet found in the proposed sample of nearby stellar systems has the best opportunity to be fully characterized with a comprehensive and robust suite of measurements."

We will eliminate false positives with follow-up Keck AO and measure their masses, a critical parameter for atmospheric modeling, with Yale Keck-HIRES time.  With planets suitable for atmospheric follow-up (i.e., typically planets with large atmospheres), we will use Yale time on a new, near-IR spectrograph, MRO-NESSI, to measure and characterize their atmospheres.  The host star brightness will allow for robust measurements of their pressure-temperature profiles and atmospheric compositions, adding to the extremely small collection of other exoplanets with well-characterized atmospheres orbiting bright stars.  Other potential discoveries include the presence of disequilibrium chemistry and thermal inversions.  A well-characterized exoplanet atmosphere provides important information on planet formation, the planet_x005F_x005Fs structure, and fundamental atmospheric physics, while also providing the crucial building blocks towards future measurements of a habitable, Earth-like planet_x005F_x005Fs atmosphere.

The discovery of the transiting candidates will be made via a transit-finding computer algorithm and by visual inspection of the light curves for this limited set of stars. To engage the public in this search, we will feature these light curves on the citizen science Planet Hunters project (PI: D. Fischer and C. Lintott) to allow our public volunteers to participate in the search for transiting planets.  This project continues Kepler_x005F_x005Fs legacy of discovering and characterizing planets. The ability to complete this project is enabled by Kepler_x005F_x005Fs wide-field, continuous monitoring to achieve precise photometric observations for a large number of stars simultaneously.  The deliverable of this project will be at least one bright, nearby exoplanet with measured atmospheric properties. These bright stars will be prime targets for subsequent studies and may eventually serve as targets for the search for life on other planets."
GO4073,4,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Gaensicke, Boris Teddy; Farihi, Jay",A Search for Transiting Objects Orbiting White Dwarf Stars,"Given their small size, white dwarf stars present a very intriguing sample to monitor for transiting objects. The transit of an Earth-sized planet could cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations.  While no white dwarf is currently known to have a transiting object, there are several indications that planetary material is present in orbit around white dwarfs, including detected debris disks and observations of accreted material in the atmosphere of the white dwarf.  The fact that we do not have a detection of a transiting object around a white dwarf may not be due to the intrinsic physical properties of the white dwarf star and its formation, but the small numbers of searched systems.  While small in number (we anticipate less than 50 targets per campaign), the accumulation of sources over the entire K2 mission is significant to detect or place strong limits on planets around white dwarfs.  These observations would be sensitive to small planetary objects (including asteroids) in a wide range of orbits, including throughout the habitable zone of the white dwarf in which orbital periods range from 4-32 hours.  A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates.  Indeed, given the small size of the host star, atmospheric characterization of terrestrial planets is much simpler if transiting a white dwarf than a solar-like star.  Therefore, in the coming decades our strongest constraints on biomarkers in terrestrial planets may very well come from a planet in orbit around a white dwarf."
GO4074,4,Sarbani,,Basu,Yale University,sarbani.basu@yale.edu,,An asteroseismic study with K2 of solar-like oscillators in four open clusters,"K2 fields 4 and 5 offer us the unprecedented opportunity to study four very interesting open clusters: Pleiades, Hyades, M44 and M67. We propose to do an asteroseismic study of stars in these clusters using solar-type oscillators.
 While all four clusters have been well studied, most depend on isochrone fitting to determine cluster properties. The properties therefore depend on the assumed distance to the cluster and the extinction too. Asteroseismic studies will allow us to determine properties of the cluster that do not depend on the distances and are only indirectly dependent on the extinction.  Since these stars in each cluster should have a very small spread of ages and metallicities, an ensemble study of these stars will also allow us to test different aspects of the theory of stellar structure and evolution.
 The targets of our study are predominantly main-sequence and subgiant stars. Consequently, all our targets need to be observed in the short cadence.  The proposal team covers all the expertise needed: time series analysis, peak-bagging to determine frequencies, asteroseismic analyses of the frequencies, expertise on rotation and stellar activities which might make interpretation difficult as well as abundance analyses needed for the complete analysis of the asteroseismic data."

While the variability occuring in the timescale of months and years can be easily characterized from the Earth, the study of light variations occuring in the time scale of minutes, days and weeks do require a space-based, nearly uninterrupted observations.    Experienced from our MOST satellite campaigns of several brigth CTTS, a few weeks long nearly-continous photometric observations analyzed with Fourier and wavelet techniques are crucial for characterisation of accretion effects, playing major role in photometric variablity of the stars. Additionally, observations made with a minute time-resolution are necessary for detection of short lasting small dips in light curves of young stars, likely caused by hypothetical ""dusty clumps"", occulting small hot spots on the stars produced during the plasma accretion from the disc."

These targets clearly illustrate the range of variability timescales present in the lightcurves of accreting compact objects, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days).

Besides the classical pulsators, some of the proposed targets are magnetic B stars, or fast-rotator Be stars. While the nominal Kepler mission already implied a revolution in stellar physics of solar-like stars and red giants, similar achievements were not possible for massive OB stars as most of such targets were avoided in the FoV in order not to disturb the exoplanet hunting. Now we can fill this hole in mission capacity by focusing on the metal factories of the Universe, for which current theories of stellar structure and evolution are least adequate. We will put constraints on physical processes which are either missing from, or ill-constrained in theory via forward modelling based on the analysis of the proposed K2 photometry and of ground-based spectroscopic data, which will be assembled with the HERMES spectrograph (1.2m Mercator telescope on La Palma, Spain) and the spectro-polarimetric NARVAL instrument (2m BLT at the Pic du Midi, French Pyrenees), to which we have guaranteed access."

We have identified 243 suitable targets for campaigns 4 and 5. This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST.

Our proposed targets have previously been observed by the ground-based SuperWASP project; no evidence was found for close-in gas giant planets orbiting any of the stars.

Small companions to close-in gas giants are rare, and solar-type stars are known to host large numbers of small planets. Therefore a search around stars that have already been vetted for the presence of close-in gas giants has a high probability of detecting planets small, potentially rocky planets.

The sensitivity of K2 is orders of magnitude better than that of SuperWASP. As such it will be able to find the signatures of small planets that are hiding in the noise on the SuperWASP measurements. Moreover WASP target stars are bright, and thus radial velocity follow-up to confirm the planets and measure their masses is feasible."

Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence. Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100 AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013). In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star.  Science Goal 2: Provide benchmark gyrochronology systems. Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components. Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars. By including wide binary components as Kepler targets, we will produce a valuable legacy product to test and recalibrate gyrochronology relations allowing the ages of field stars to be more accurately determined.  
We have used the proper motion catalog of Kraus et al. (2014) to select pairs of objects with common proper motion. We have restricted ourselves to objects with significant proper motions above 30 milliarcseconds per year and have also set a condition of common distance (using distance moduli derived from SED fitting). In Fields 4 and 5 we also specifically exclude objects in the Pleiades and Praesepe which could contaminate our sample. We then restricted our sample to pairs which were close enough to make them unlikely to be purely coincident pairings between unrelated field stars. This resulted in 246 targets on silicon in fields 4 and 5.
 Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. We already have 116 targets accepted for Field 1 with 98 targets proposed for Field 3 (Field 2 suffers from crowding making clean target selection difficult). This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity."

For example, we have strong evidence that there is more than one pulsation mechanism at work in Delta Sct stars, showing that convection in the outer envelope can play an important role (Antoci et al. 2011, Antoci et al., submitted). Kurtz et al. (2014) measured for the first time the internal rotation rate for a Delta Sct/Gamma Dor hybrid from examination of splittings of individual oscillation modes.

Here we propose to observe all known pulsators, fainter than 7th magnitude in the V band, of Gamma Dor, Delta Sct, SPB and Be type as well as stars with reliable spectral type identification and atmospheric parameter measurements (v sin i, Teff , log g, ...). Our selected stars are located in clusters that are visible in campaigns 4 and 5. We wish to observe over a hundred of stars in these clusters. The Pleiades, NGC 1647, Hyades, M44 and M67 cover a range of ages (approximately 100 Myr to 4.8 Gyr) and offer _x005F_x005Fsnapshots_x005F_x005F in the life of stars over a range of masses with approximately the same initial chemical composition. All clusters, with the exception of M67, are young enough to harbour pulsating, intermediate-mass stars on or near the main sequence. In the case of M67 the turn-off mass is only slightly higher than the solar one, meaning that all massive stars have evolved off the main sequence. However, this cluster has several known pulsating blue stragglers, which are thought to be the product of mergers or accretion in binary systems. The true origin of these stars is still under debate but studying their oscillations may uncover their formation scenario. For example, the helium content in the merger scenario is higher and this will influence the oscillatory behaviour, which we can measure. In other words the K2 mission can for the first time offer a homogeneous sample of oscillating intermediate-mass stars over a range of well determined ages and chemical compositions.

Work plan: After basic photometric reductions and identification of the pulsation modes, we plan to do an asteroseismic analyses of the light curves and explore their oscillatory behaviour. We will use the asteroseismic results to test the recently suggested driving mechanism proposed by Antoci et al. (submitted), which is related to the turbulent pressure in the stellar envelope. We will also probe the edges of the instability regions in the HR diagram and select the best targets to do theoretical in-depth studies. K2 is the only mission in the near future, to do the science proposed here because it delivers homogeneous observations and long uninterrupted data sets of pulsating stars in clusters with sufficient precision over a large range of magnitudes. We will be able to determine the oscillation frequencies unambiguously even for the stars oscillating with periods shorter than the Nyquist frequency imposed by the LC data, as studied by Murphy et al. (in prep).

To summarize, the combination of homogeneous K2 observations with already available ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data as well as constrains set from cluster ensemble studies and eclipsing binary systems is a unique opportunity to do asteroseismic studies of early-type stars."

We propose a survey of 1648 low-luminosity RGB stars (with radii between ~3.5-8 solar radii) using long-cadence data to detect transiting gas-giant planets with K2. Since RGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with K2 long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planet candidates. The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics.

The necessary measurements consist of (1) Kepler high-accuracy but broadband characterization of the periods, phases, amplitudes, and waveforms of each star's rotational modulation, correlated with (2) multi-epoch, multi-color ground-based photometry, and spectroscopy.  This combination will allow separate measurements of starspot area and effective temperature, by fitting spot models to observed variations in the stellar colors.

K2 can provide a unique set of 2.5 month samplings of this variability by observing a sample of accreting and non-accreting T Tauri stars, but additional contemporaneous ground-based photometry and spectroscopy will be required to interpret and model the K2 light-curves. We propose to observe 20 members of the Taurus star-formation region that fall on active Field 4 silicon. Their Kepler magnitudes cover the range 9-19, but with most brighter than m_Kep=15, and, thus, are well-suited to standard K2 observing methods.

GO4093,4,Mike,D,Reed,Missouri State University,mikereed@missouristate.edu,,Understanding extreme horizontal branch stars via asteroseismology,"We propose to explore core structure of horizontal branch stars by applying asteroseismological tools to Kepler data of extreme horizontal branch (spectral class subdwarf B) stars. Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars. Many happen to pulsate, and that allows us to probe their structure. From Kepler's main mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes and to constrain structure models from period spacings and frequency multiplets.

        Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age since some stars show substantial mode trapping while in others it appears to be absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of different evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models.

        Frequency multiplets also tell us the rotation period and orientation of the pulsation axis. From this information we have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary period down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components.

        We made significant progress from the original Kepler mission. However, to fully exploit those advances, we need to complete the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). It would also be a huge benefit to have more examples of pulsators in binaries, as that allows us to further explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection.

        To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of a selection of likely sdB pulsators and long-cadence (LC) observations of remaining sdB stars. The SC data can fully explore pulsations and short-period (1 day) binaries and while the LC data can detect some pulsations while still exploring binary sdB stars, especially the longer-period ones.

        Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.

        We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include graduate and undergraduate students as signficant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training."
GO4095,4,Marcel,,Agueros,Columbia University,marcel@astro.columbia.edu,"Law, Nicholas M; Kraus, Adam L; Douglas, Stephanie T; Covey, Kevin; Cargile, Phillip A",HyPra: Characterizing the Rotation-Activity Relation At 600 Myr With K2 Light Curves And Ground-Based Spectroscopy,"Forty years ago, Andrew Skumanich proposed that rotation and chromospheric activity, a proxy for magnetic field strength, decrease at roughly the same rate for solar-type stars between the ages of 100 and 500 Myr. The existence of an age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR) has generated hope that measurements of rotation and/or activity can be used to obtain the ages of field stars. Unfortunately, however, a robust, quantitative, theoretically motivated description of the ARAR still eludes us.

Empirical forms of the ARAR rely largely on observations of stars in open clusters: these stars' well-defined ages make them valuable targets for measuring rotation periods and indicators of magnetic activity such as Halpha line strengths and X-ray luminosities. However, ages derived from empirical ARARs rarely have uncertainties better than 50%. Open clusters are relatively rare, particularly at older ages, so that calibrating the ARAR between a few 100 Myr and the age of the Sun is difficult. And until recently, there was little overlap between the clusters used to measure periods and those used to measure activity. Rotation studies often focused on distant clusters, whose smaller angular sizes maximize the number of stars whose periods can be measured efficiently with multi-epoch imaging of a few fields. Activity studies targeted nearby clusters, for which high signal-to-noise data can be obtained with single-object spectroscopy or in all-sky X-ray surveys.

Over the last several years, we have engaged in a large-scale campaign to systematically map out rotation and activity in open clusters ranging in age from 35 Myr to 3 Gyr. Our focus is on calibrating the ARAR for low-mass stars, which dominate most stellar populations by number and have lifetimes exceeding the age of the Galaxy. As every low-mass star formed in the Milky Way still resides on the main sequence, using an improved ARAR to derive reliable ages for these stars would provide invaluable insight into the chemical evolution and star formation history of the Galaxy. Furthermore, the first habitable Earth-like planet is likely to be discovered around an old, low-mass field star: understanding this planet's radiation environment and current habitability will require an improved ARAR that can be applied to its parent star. Currently, however, we must invert the process, adopting canonical ages for the field-star population to constrain the ARAR Recently, we examined the relationship between activity and rotation in the Hyades and Praesepe, two benchmark, roughly 600-Myr-old clusters. Because these are two of the nearest, best-studied open clusters, empirical calibrations of the ARAR often interpolate directly between the observed properties of their members (and particularly of Hyads) and those of the Sun. We found that the Hyades and Praesepe follow an identical color-activity, and therefore age-activity, relation, implying that we can use the merged HyPra sample to characterize stellar properties at 600 Myr (Douglas et al. 2014).

We propose to obtain K2 light curves for every accessible HyPra member. The K2 campaign is an extraordinary opportunity to complete the sample of period measurements for stars in these two clusters, providing access to longer, lower-amplitude signals than can currently be measured from the ground. In addition, the K2 campaign will allow us to disentangle real stellar variability from some of the systematic effects that plague ground-based period measurements. Combining the K2 data with existing and new spectroscopy, we will provide new constraints on the operation of stellar dynamos and calibrate a valuable tool for age-dating stars and exoplanets. This proposal therefore directly supports NASA's goal of understanding exoplanetary systems."

Based on our Kepler GO2, GO3 and GO4 data, we have developed techniques to obtain high quality long-term LCs from Kepler data: these methods will be applied to the K2 data.  Concurrent with the K2 observations, we will observe our K2 targets with ground-based facilities. When a SN appears in the field, we will issue a trigger to a large community of SN observers to obtain additional spectra and multi-color data sets. In combination with the K2 data, these SNe will be some of the best observed SN events, and these data will lead to: 1) a significant improvement in our understanding of the explosion mechanism of supernovae, 2) better calibration of SNe and therefore better luminosity distances for cosmological studies and 3) better constraints on the equation of state of dark energy."

Ground-base monitoring of short-term variations are strongly limited by weather and the diurnal cycle, while long-term monitoring is effected by seasonal observing windows.  Kepler permits monitoring of galaxies which is sensitive to both continuous variability, especially millimag-level variations from embedded active nuclei and random episodic events, such as supernovae and accretion events induced by tidal disruption of stars orbiting near a SMBH.  The primary objectives of this proposal are (a) to expand the baseline of time-domain observations of galactic systems with emphasis on galaxy types not well represented in the Kepler and previous K2 campaigns; (b) quantify the frequency of and amplitude of optical AGN signals in galaxy cores, both quasi-continuous and episodic, and (c) provide a direct measure of supernovae rates across galaxy types, focusing on starburst systems.  The reduced sensitivity expected in the K2 campaign still opens up parameter space not accessible from the ground for the topics described above.  Goal (b) and (c) are statistical in nature, in which the desire for very large samples to improve detection statistics must be balanced against overall target availability and competing science in each campaign.  Measuring the frequency of AGN signals informs on the widely accepted but unproven paradigm that all galaxies contain a central supermassive black hole whose mass scales roughly with the total galaxy mass. For goal (c) we will emphasis starburst systems to improve the odds of detecting the initial light from multiple Type II supernovae.

One method of stellar age determination, gyrochronology, relies on the color and rotation period of a star; rotation rate offers direct insight into the evolution of stellar angular momentum and decreases with stellar age. Previous studies have found that wide binaries are an ideal sample for constraining gyrochronology models and are particularly useful for age-dating older and low-mass stars (i.e., where empirical methods of age determination are most needed). Using the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog and the fourth U.S. Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog, we identified 9786 common proper motion binaries in K2 Fields 4 and 5 and will use long-cadence observations of a subset of these pairs to measure photometric rotation periods and recalibrate the age-rotation relationship. Additionally, given well-determined ages for a sample of binaries with attending planets, we can also extrapolate planetary ages and begin to constrain planet formation and evolution scenarios using an absolute timescale."

In the next few years, multiple instruments on 8-10m class telescopes will be upgraded or commissioned from scratch to reach the ~1 m/s in the infrared RV measurement precision necessary to detect habitable Earth-mass planets around nearby M dwarfs. However, with this considerable effort and potential telescope time being placed on detecting such light-weight planets, it is critical that we invest some effort in learning as much as possible about the atmospheric characteristics of the planet host target stars _x005F_x005F the M dwarfs. Indeed, there is still much to be learned about the interiors and atmospheres of the most populous star in the galaxy. There are still inconsistencies between measured radii and those predicted be stellar models. Also, we have much to learn about the interplay between the convective and magnetically driven processes that affect the light curves and RV measurements obtained for these popular planet search targets.

While M dwarfs offer some unique advantages, it is important to search for, characterize and understand exoplanets smaller than Neptune around stars closer in spectral type to our own. We propose to use K2 to carry out a search for transits of small planets around bright F, G and K stars.

	Small planets in such systems will be well suited to follow-up with radial velocity in order to determine their masses thanks to the brightness of the host stars. Stars with spectral types from late F to K should have sufficiently low vsini values, but also lower activity levels than M stars, therefore being ideal for RV measurements. They will also be suitable targets for atmospheric studies, and will make up a valuable sample for understanding how the structures, atmospheric compositions and orbital properties of these planets vary as a function of stellar spectral type. Ultimately, these measurements will enable us to constrain the formation and evolution of these planetary systems.

Target selection and expected yield: For our target selection, we began with all stars from the EPIC that fall on silicon during campaigns 4 and 5. We only kept stars with Kepler magnitudes brighter than 12 to ensure the ability to obtain mass determinations for the expected small transiting planets using high resolution spectrographs such as HARPS and HIRES. These systems will also be sufficiently bright to be accessible to current and upcoming space telescopes such as the HST, Spitzer, JWST and CHEOPS. Using a B-V colour cut, we then filtered out stars of types earlier than mid-F (B-V < 0.5) and later than M (B-V > 1.4). We further removed likely giants and subgiants by filtering out stars with proper motions smaller than 4 mas/yr. Our final sample of targets includes 2408 and 2835 stars in campaigns 4 and 5, respectively.  	From occurrence studies based on Kepler statistics of small planets around FGK stars, we expect to discover of the order of 100 new small planets during campaigns 4 and 5 as part of this survey.

Methodology: The majority of the targets we propose will be saturated. However, it has been demonstrated on both Kepler and K2 data that high-precision photometry is achievable even for saturated stars by using larger, customized apertures to ensure collection of all the light bled down columns and into adjacent pixels. We will use a similar method to extract photometry for saturated stars. Because centroiding will be difficult for those targets, we will use the pixel position of a nearby star to de-correlate the pixel position from the target photometry, an important step in analysing K2 data.

Relevance to ROSES 2014 and K2 GO - Cycle 1 solicitations: This proposal addresses the following NASA and K2 objectives and motivations: understand how small exoplanets form and determine the incidence of planets able to support life in the Universe. Specifically, this program will provide numerous bright systems hosting small planets amenable to follow-up studies that, together with the K2 data, will place constraints on their formation. It will also assess the composition and diversity of small planets around solar-type stars, thereby contributing to our understanding of how common life is in the Universe."

Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. Indeed, eclipsing binary systems allow for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, which can then be compared with asteroseismic estimates. Eclipsing binaries are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough. So far, all the published stars known to both display solar-like oscillations and belong to eclipsing binaries are red-giants, and all have been detected by the Kepler mission (Hekker et al. 2010, Gaulme et al. 2013 & 2014, Beck et al. 2014). The purpose of this GO proposal is to observe a small set of eclipsing binaries, including either a red-giant or a main-sequence solar-like star, that are already well characterized in terms of physical parameters (orbits, masses, radii). Doing so present two main advantages. Firstly, observing well-known systems helps predicting the likelihood of detecting solar-like oscillations. Secondly, the objective is to reduce the burden of ground-based follow-up, which is very time-consuming when radial-velocities need to be measured."

Given their short orbital periods, building the requisite signal-to-noise to detect the candidates by stacking multiple transits requires a much shorter observational baseline than for longer-period planets, and the transits are likely more robust than those of longer-period planets. Likewise, ground-based follow-up to study the host stars spectrally and estimate the planets' masses via radial-velocity measurements require only modest resources. In this proposal, we briefly describe our plans for using K2 photometry to find more very short-period planets orbiting Sun-like stars and to follow them up with ground-based spectral observations. We request data for 999 targets, split between campaigns 4 and 5, making this a ``small'' proposal, and we will focus especially on involving students in the research. Given the estimated frequencies of very short-period planets, we expect to find between 5 and 10 such objects -- a small enough number that a dedicated ground-based follow-up program is imminently feasible but still scientifically compelling."

E.",A Novel Class of Spotted/Pulsating Binaries: Models and Analysis,"We propose K2 long cadence observations of 10 Algol-type systems in Fields 4 and 5 to study a new class of short-period interacting binaries that we discovered during Kepler Cycles 1-4.   Kepler  observations revealed that several systems with Algol-like light curves display unequal brightness at their quadrature phases and that the quadrature brightness ratio varies from  > 1 to <1 on a time scale of about 100-400 days. We call these binaries L/T (Leading/Trailing hemisphere) variables. This behavior has never been reported in Algol light curves from ground-based photometry.  Some of the L/T systems show delta Scuti-like pulsations on the primary. From the new observations of Algols in K2 Fields 4 and 5, we will investigate the prevalence of the L/T phenomenon in short-period systems and look for the behavior in longer-period Algols in which the gas stream misses the primary star. The L/T phenomenon is likely a result of star spot activity.  If the L/T variations are due to hot accretion spots, the L/T phenomenon is a diagnostic of stream behavior (either from normal  hydrodynamic flow resulting in shock heating in a direct-impact scenario or impact from a magnetically-controlled stream from the secondary). If the L/T changes are the result of variations in size and distribution of cool spots on the secondary, we gain information on the surface magnetic activity on the mass loser. We propose short cadence observations of the well-known totally-eclipsing system S Cancri from which we can study flare and spot variability on the secondary and variability in its extended atmosphere that is visible just before/just after totality. Pulsation frequencies and behavior will be extracted from the data to compare with Kepler observations of L/T variables.  The K2 light curves will be modeled with the newest version of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) program (Wilson 2012) that includes the treatment of variable/migrating star spots.  Stellar and spot parameters are determined.  K2 provides the continuous photometric coverage of high precision that allows one to identify L/T binaries and study the L/T phenomenon, as the variations are less than 3% of the quadrature flux.  A continuous train of eclipse data over many orbital cycles is needed to characterize the variability, including degree of the flux variations and its phase dependence. The project will yield information on the detailed physics of mass transfer, especially the roles of accretion hot spots and magnetic fields, and also test the new WD program (that will be made available to the community) for future applications by others working with the K2 database."

However, they have stronger fluxes in the nIR. Planets as small as the Earth will cause transits with depths of 0.5-2%. The CARMENES instrument is expected to start operations at the end of 2015. It is a stabilized optical+infrared spectrograph covering from 0.5 to 1.7 microns at R=82,000, whose Doppler precision is at 1 m/s level and will use 600 nights of GTO time at the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope between 2015 and 2018). Such precision and amount of telescope time will allow for the systematic detection of Earth-mass planets in the HZ of low mass stars. M dwarfs, even appearing faint at optical wavelengths (e.g. V,r' ~ 14-18 mag), have sufficient flux in the optical red and nIR to attain the m/s precision. We kindly request to the K2 team to observe as many late type M stars in fields 4 & 5 as possible. This proposal contains a sample of mid to late M-stars that we could identify. Several planet candidates have been reported in the original Kepler field but they tend to be early type M stars (M0V to M3V, Muirhead et al. 2012 ApJ, Dressing & Charbonneau 2013 ApJ, Martin et al. 2013 A&A). As a result, not much is gained in the red-nIR in terms of flux and follow-up is difficult, if not impossible, with current means such as HARPS-N. Raw pixel-level photometry will be analyzed using the SARS pipeline, and light curves will be searched for planet candidates using Optimal Boxed-Least-Squares (Ofir 2013, A&A). All stars will be analized for rotation periods and characteristics of their noise properties (time-scales of correlated noise, flare rates, etc.). Assuming the range of likely densities, Doppler amplitudes will be estimated and targets with enough predicted signal will be followed-up with CARMENES. Comfirmation and mass measurements are necessary preliminary steps before attempting spectroscopic characterization with near-future NASA's telescopes (HST and Spitzer but especially JWST). The favorable planet to star radius and mass ratios of the targets in this sample will likely produce the first fully characterizable Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of a star."

Large efforts have been made worldwide to generate standard stars to better than 1%, with the best efforts going to using DA White Dwarfs as on-chip standards. The general bias is that non-binary DA WDs (away from the ZZ Ceti instability strip) should be extremely stable in their brightness, but this has never been tested to better than 1% or so over a broad range of time scales.  (Ground-based telescopes do not have the stability, while HST does not have the cadence to test for variability on most timescales.)  If DA WDs are stable to the 0.1% level or so, then they would make excellent standards for supernova cosmology.  But, if a substantial fraction of DA WDs are variable at more than the ~0.3% level, then this solution will not work as planned.  The original Kepler field had 11 non-binary DA WDs, and our analysis shows 3-out-of-11 have >0.44% RMS intrinsic variation with timescales from 0.5-5 days, while 5-out-of-11 have >0.23% RMS intrinsic variations.  With this small-number statistics, the use of white dwarfs as standards for supernova cosmology is dubious.  But the numbers from the original Kepler field are too small to support any conclusions that are far-reaching for the big projects. To get substantial statistics on white dwarf variability, we propose to observe the 6 DA WDs in Fields 4 and 5 of the K2 mission that are brighter than 16.5 mag.  (We will add further systems in later K2 fields.)  Our goal is to measure the variability of large numbers of DA WDs, to test whether they can be used as standard stars for supernova cosmology."
GO5004,5,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,,Short-Duration Flares on Mira Stars,"With the year-long pulsational periods for Mira stars, it came as a startling surprise when many groups found short-duration (minutes to days) flares with amplitudes 0.4-1.4 mag.  Even now, little is known about these Mira flares, mainly because they are rare and because the small number of prior light curves have poor-cadence, poor stability, and inadequate accuracy.  Theoretical ideas have no detail, mainly because the observations are poor, with typical proposed mechanisms relating to magnetic reconnection associated with big loops tied in to close-in planets.  This observational and theoretical stagnation can be uniquely broken with the K2 mission, where the multiple fields will cover many Mira stars, allowing for wonderful light curves with millimag accuracy and no gaps for ~75 days each.  So I am proposing to observe 4 Miras in Field 4 and 3 Miras in Field 5.  The millimag accuracy in the K2 light curves will allow for the discovery of the presumably more-frequent flares of low amplitude.  The main data analysis will be the identification of short flares, and the measurement of their properties (duration, amplitude, energy, light curve shape, and phase in the Mira cycle).  These products will be used to create demographic results, like flare frequency/size/duration as a function of Mira type, period, and phase.  The K2 mission, and only the K2 mission, can turn the field from data-starved to data-rich.  Finally, the theorists will have something that they can work with."

We propose to observe more than 9000 M dwarfs in the K2 campaign 4 and 5 fields to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate ~100 small planets around the M dwarfs in fields 4 and 5 and ~400 from the full K2-MDP program.

This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs within 100pc of the Sun with little contamination. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date.

As a result, we have little information on the evolution of the magnetic field of main sequences stars in this final stage of evolution except for those with anomalously strong fields. This program will use very sensitive photometric observations of white dwarfs by Kepler/K2 to search for rotational modulation of the flux from low-magnetic field white dwarf stars caused by magnetic phenomena (such as starspots and plages).   On the expected white dwarf rotation periods (about 1 day, generalizing from nonradially pulsating white dwarfs), the low amplitude of the expected variations renders them extremely difficult to detect using ground-based photometry. K2 will be able to observe many well-studied field white dwarfs and many in the Pleiades, Hyades, and M44. Measurement of rotation modulation (or even upper limits to photometric amplitude variations)  will further exploit those data to teach us about magnetic fields in these stars that are otherwise inaccessible observationally.  In the case of ZZ Ceti pulsators, we may for the first time independently measure the rotation rate, providing a test of asteroseismic rotation periods."

Önehag et al. (2011, A&A, 528, A85) find that solar twins in M67 have photospheric spectra that are virtually indistinguishable from the Sun_x005F_x005Fs at echelle resolutions.  Therefore, K2 data would enable for the first time a high-precision comparison of the variability characteristics of solar analogs to that of the Sun, which is characterized by cycle-related variability at the level of about 0.1% (1 mmag) and a superimposed rotational modulation by spots with amplitudes in the 1 _x005F_x005F 3 millimag range.  Our primary observational objective in this proposal is to obtain estimates of rotation periods of solar-type stars in M67 with previous Ca II activity measurements from Giampapa et al. (2006, ApJ, 651, 444). The results from this program will provide important constraints for (1) the relationship between activity and rotation at solar age and (2) the angular momentum evolution in sun-like stars.

The solar counterparts in M67 have an apparent brightness of V ~ 14.5.  Therefore, the benchmark precision of 170 ppm for V=12 G2 V stars in one long cadence (LC) observation can be attained in 5 hours or the equivalent of 10 LC observations.  Alternatively, a precision of 0.5 mmag needed to resolve rotational modulation in the 0.1% _x005F_x005F 0.2%  range could be achieved in about 0.6 hours or two LC sequences.  Approximately 2.8 solar-like rotation periods (~ 27d) could be observed in the ~ 75-day duration of K2 Field 5 observation. Our approach will be to analyze sequences of 2 _x005F_x005F 10 LC observations for rotation measures and single LC sequences for transient activity.  The K2 data will be augmented by a contemporaneous survey of the program targets using Lowell Observatory's new 4.3-m Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT).

While the specific objective is to obtain rotation measures of solar counterparts in M67, K2 observations of M67 will yield additional perspectives on the variability of its many solar-type stars at precisions that are unattainable from the ground for the M67 solar analogs (V ~ 14.5). The frequency of occurrence of _x005F_x005Fsuperflaring_x005F_x005F (Notsu et al. 2013; Maehara et al. 2012) in sun-like stars at solar age could be investigated for the first time in addition to other forms of transient activity, each of which could impact the conditions in exoplanetary systems.  In summary of one important application, the K2 data-set for M67 would be an indispensible first step towards the characterization of the conditions of the habitable zones in sun-like stars at solar age.  Finally, transits of super-Earths and larger exoplanets could be detected.  These goals are scientifically and technically compatible with the K2 mission while scientifically relevant to NASA programs such as Habitable Worlds and Living With A Star."

Success will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the source of its chemical evolution. This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we currently have achieved mainly for the solar neighborhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology - better known as Galactic Archaeology - has used Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismic-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.

AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number (about 5,000 per campaign) of colour-magnitude selected red giants to probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighborhood. This is a continuing program initiated during Campaign-0, and it is our intention to make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before, taking advantage of K2's 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxy's structure and evolution from its stellar populations.

METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by ground-based spectroscopy and photometry from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, RAVE, and SAGA). We will use our seismic inferred stellar properties to stress-test state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."

Instead, Doppler tomography (where we spectroscopically resolve the distortions in the spectral line shape during the transit of a planet around a rapidly rotating star) and analysis of the orbital phase curve (where we detect the combined effects of Doppler beaming and ellipsoidal variations of the host star and reflected light from the planet) can be used to validate planet candidates around these stars. We propose to use K2 to search for transiting planet candidates around a sample of main sequence A and early F stars in order to expand the sample of known planets around these stars and enable statistical investigations of this largely unexplored population; we will then validate the resulting planet candidates using Doppler tomography and phase curve analysis. Doppler tomography also allows the measurement of the (mis)alignment between the stellar spin and the planetary orbital plane, an important parameter for investigating planetary migration processes. This investigation will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population, planet formation, and planet migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."""

This will allow for calibrating the rotation_x005F_x005Fage relationship for main-sequence stars older than ~1 Gyr for the first time. Such rotation-based ages are precise to ~10%, which exceeds any other current method of determining ages of stars in the Galactic field. We will expand on our ongoing work to characterize and quantify the limitations of both Kepler and K2 data.

Based on the underlying premise that stars are born with an initial distribution of rotation periods and slow down over time as they shed angular momentum, Barnes et al. have have suggested an empirical framework for measuring stellar ages from their rotation periods. This paradigm, gyrochronology, works well for solar-type stars in young clusters and, apart from asteroseismology, is the most precise way to measure stellar ages of individual stars. Binary (or multiple) star systems are essentially small open clusters, albeit with just two members. While not able to provide the statistical power of the dozens of stars typical in an open cluster, an ensemble of binary systems in the Galactic field can be even more powerful as they span a range of ages, metallicities, and evolutionary histories that provide a truly heterogeneous population. Past the age of <1 Gyr, binaries are also much closer and brighter than open clusters. As all but the most massive open clusters, which are further away and fainter, become unbound after <1 Gyr, their utility is limited as lower-MS dwarfs tend to escape first, limiting their availability as age benchmarks. Lastly, components of wide binaries with semi-major axes s500 AU are coeval and evolve independently with no discernible effect on each other. Therefore, to test and calibrate gyrochronology for older stars, binary and multiple systems represent powerful keystones."

The transit of a planet, combined with radial velocity measurements, provides the mass and the radius of the planet, the planetary brightness temperature, the planetary day-night difference, and absorption features of the planetary upper-atmosphere constituents like sodium, hydrogen, water, and methane.

In our current knowledge of the Earth, little is known about its evolution during the first hundreds of million years. It is important to understand the evolution of exoplanets with time to provide key information in the early history and composition of our planet. This work aims at addressing important aspects such as (1) the frequency of planets in clusters, (2) the evolution of planet interiors as a function of age, and (3) planet formation models and the effect of migration. To address these questions, we plan to take advantage of the Kepler K2 mission that will monitor several nearby clusters/regions with a wide range of age for 70--80 days continuously during campaigns 4 and 5: rho Oph (~1 Myr), Upper Scorpius (5-10 Myr), the Pleiades (125 Myr), Praesepe (590 Myr), and the Hyades (625 Myr). The main advantage of cluster members is that they are born in the same cloud at the time under the same environment. Hence, they represent ideal targets to look at the formation and structure of planetary systems and the evolution with time of the composition and atmosphere of exoplanets. We will be sensitive to short period super-Earths and larger planets around well-characterised young solar-type star and M dwarf members. If the current empirical frequency of planets hold at young ages, we expect to discovery at least one super-Earth per cluster. The frequency of planets at young ages is currently unknown and only 2.8% of the hundreds of the planet-host stars known to date are younger than 600 Myr.

Our team will focus on the Pleiades, Praesepe, and Hyades where we identified bona-fide cluster members photometrically and astrometrically in an homogeneous manner using the near-infrared survey conducted by the UKIDSS Galactic Clusters Survey. We have already obtained optical spectra for a large number of member candidates with a battery of telescopes and instruments. We have also obtained high-resolution lucky-imaging data for more than 500 high-mass and low-mass members of the Pleiades and Praesepe, which will be combined with other works conducted in the Hyades. Hence, we know the level of activity, spectral type, temperature, and multiplicity properties of our target stars.

We compiled the most up-to-date list of high-mass and low-mass members in the Pleiades, Praesepe, and Hyades clusters with a wide range of spectral types and magnitudes using the catalogues of Stauffer et al. (2007, ApJS, 172, 663), Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007, AJ, 134, 2340), and Goldman et al. (2013, A&A, 559, 43) complemented by our latest studies."

At ages of 100 and 600 Myr, the Pleiades and the Hyades are the ideal targets to constrain spindown models. In contrast to solar-mass stars, the spindown of VLM objects, especially in the substellar domain, is very poorly understood, particularly due to a lack of empirical constraints.  Kepler-2 will help us to remedy this situation. We expect to derive hundreds of VLM periods, an improvement by a factor of ~4 compared with the existing literature. This will enable us to derive the spindown timescales for VLM objects as a function of mass and to provide critical constraints for wind models in this mass domain. The lightcurves will be useful for a variety of secondary science projects, including the search for benchmark eclipsing binaries and for the first close-in planets around brown dwarfs."

With the K2 observations we will model the high-frequency variability with the current fluctuating accretion disk model, thus inferring disk geometry and viscosity for both systems. This will enable us to perform a comparative study between the aperiodic variability properties of dwarf nova versus nova-like cataclysmic variables, and determine whether previously reported differences are consistently found within other systems.

Although astronomers have measured the radii of many of these worlds to impressive precision by combining photometry with detailed characterization of planet host stars, the masses of the vast majority of small planets are completely unconstrained. There are only seven planets smaller than 2.5 Earth radii with published mass uncertainties smaller than 20%, the minimum value required to begin to discriminate between models of planet composition.  Our K2 Campaign 4 and 5 proposal is designed to significantly advance our understanding of the compositional diversity of small planets by tripling the number of small planets with well-constrained masses and radii. We propose to observe 8692 moderately bright stars with K2 to search for transiting planets. Based on occurrence rates measured using prime Kepler mission results, we anticipate that 64 +/- 8 small, short-period planets will transit our proposed stars during the campaigns and that 35 +/- 6 of those planets will be detectable by K2. We will search for those planets in the K2 pixel data using the light curve processing and planet detection pipeline developed by J. Johnson and A. Vanderburg.  After performing an initial round of vetting tests based on the K2 photometry, we will acquire reconnaissance spectroscopy and imaging of promising planet candidates to identify the best targets for high-precision radial velocity (HPRV) observations. We anticipate conducting reconnaissance observations for 28 +/- 5 planet candidates and selecting 14 +/- 4 targets for HPRV observations.

We will conduct our HPRV observations using the HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain. HARPS-N is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 40 nights per year of guaranteed time specifically devoted to observations of small planets detected by Kepler and K2. PI D. Charbonneau is chair of the HARPS-N Science Team and the HARPS-N Target Selection Tiger Team.

We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves, reconnaissance imaging, and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet  candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N.

Our campaign to measure the masses of 14 +/- 4 small K2 planets with precision higher than 15% will have a tremendous impact on our understanding of small planets. By trebling the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful background information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."

We comprise a strong and diverse research team that will use the proposed Campaign 5 long-cadence data for M67 to yield forefront findings across a wide array of domains of stellar astrophysics. These will include: ""	Searches for exoplanet signatures; ""	Red giant asteroseismology; ""	Stellar evolution, including non-standard evolutionary paths (e.g., blue stragglers); ""	Stellar rotation and angular momentum evolution; ""	Stellar activity; ""	Eclipsing binaries and beaming.

A large superaperture augmented by targeted stars outside the cluster core will comprehensively and efficiently capture some 1400 likely cluster members. Targets of interest span Kp ~ 8 to 20, the bright end being defined by evolved red giants for asteroseismology and the faint end being M dwarfs for which Hot Jupiters will still be easily detectable.

The team has strong expertise with time-series photometry and Kepler in particular. We will provide state-of-the-art time series to the community for  more than 2,000 stars in the M67 field. Extractions using both simple aperture photometry and difference image analysis (the non-perfect guiding of K2 may provide data well- conditioned for the latter) will be performed, in addition to careful detrending of systematics in the time series.  This team also has assured access to a wide range of ground-based facilities, capabilities and data to follow-up K2 discoveries. The team leaders have extensive and successful experience with large international collaborations and major scientific projects.

Theoretical ideas all center on reconnection of magnetic fields in coronal loops, but the loops must be large and the fields strong, and this can only be done by involving the fields between the two binary star components.  But the field configurations and the detailed microphysics are not known.  RS CVn superflares have adequate observations from X-ray to optical to radio for a relatively small number of events.  But what is missing, that K2 can uniquely provide, is long coverage of many RS CVn systems to provide good and unbiased demographics, as well as the great sensitivity needed to confidently detect small amplitude events.  Kepler has not looked at any RS CVn systems previously, so we are proposing to use K2 to target 34 RS CVns in Fields 4 and 5.  With this, we will be able to push the detectable flare amplitude down by two orders-of-magnitude and our long coverage will be able to push to the largest amplitude superflares.  The great statistics from K2 will be able to perform tests like measuring the orbital phase dependence of flare frequency so as to distinguish between the magnetic loop and the magnetospheric tail reconnection models.

	RS CVn superflares fit into a larger picture of superflares on Sun-like stars, with these other superflares having similar observational properties, yet their parent stars have no apparent companions.  One likely model for superflares on Sun-like stars is the same as we describe for RS CVn flares, except that the cool star is replaced by a close-in planet as the place to anchor the magnetic loops.  A goal of this K2 proposal is to test how similar are the two types of superflares.  For example, we will test whether the size-frequency distributions are the same, with a further comparison to Solar flares.  Only K2 can do this."

The structure and rotation of this kind of stars are very complex. In contrast to the well-known solar type oscillations, there are still many unknowns regarding the oscillations in delta Scuti stars: why are hundreds of modes needed to explain the oscillations observed in their light curves? Is there a real spacing as the one seen for solar type oscillations? Could we observe different kinds of modes depending on the rotation rate compared with the critical one? Our aim is to answer these and further questions.

We want to observe up to twenty three stars in two different open clusters: the Pleiades and the Beehive clusters. We can retrieve more information from the study of stars that belong to open clusters than from isolated stars. The key assumption is that, because they have a common origin, these stars have the same characteristics and we can do an isochronal fit to estimate different parameters like age, distance or metalicity. These quantities can then be related to the oscillations observed in each one of these stars.

Furthermore, thanks to the high quality of K2 data and the new techniques that the community has developed, we can improve our results from terrestrial observations made by STEPHI's network."

Pulsating stars are very important objects because asteroseismology, the study of the properties of stellar oscillations, is the only way to probe deep interiors of stars, which otherwise remain unavailable for direct observations with our instruments. Binary stars are irreplaceable for probing models of stellar structure and evolution, as they provide us with dynamical masses, which are pure observational, model-independent values. Stars in close binary systems undergo different evolutionary scenario from single stars of similar mass, due to tidal interactions between stellar components. Thus, we get the opportunity to evaluate and further develop the tidal theory by studying close binary systems. Dynamical tidal forces in binary systems may lead to a resonant excitation of stellar pulsations in individual binary components. These tidally-induced oscillations provide a potential of probing deep stellar interiors, but the topic is currently not well explored observationally.

Recent investigations showed that present-day single-star evolutionary models are inadequate and lack a serious amount of near-core mixing when applied to binary stars. A large sample of pulsating binaries with precise masses is required to draw any firm conclusions. So far, for about a hundred of massive binaries only, the masses were derived to the required precision, and the current sample is greatly biased towards short orbital period binaries. With K2, we aim at observing about 100 members of the class of massive binary stars, which will lead to significant extension of the sample, in particular towards longer orbital periods. The key questions to be addressed in our research are: is it feasible to use the core overshoot parameter alone in an attempt to solve the mass discrepancy problem in massive binary systems? What is the role of tidally-induced pulsations in the evolution of angular momentum within a binary system? What are the key mechanisms and type of interactions that are responsible for the discrepancy between the observations and tidal evolution theory?"

Their peculiarities are thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration. Stars need to be rotating slower than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 2_x005F_x005F10 days.

Recent studies have found that a significant fraction of Am stars have low-level pulsations, which is at odds with the need for stability to produce the chemical peculiarities. In addition there is increasing evidence for planets orbiting around A-type stars.

Using K2 we will collect a statistically-significant sample of  Am stars, in order to: 1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binarity within the Am stars, 3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars.

We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary.

In conclusion, the K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's stars, a local halo M subdwarf, the stars of the Galactic halo population are now known to harbor exoplanets as well as those of the Galactic disk. However, very little is currently known about the prevalence and properties of the exoplanets in the halo. Our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed in campaigns 4-5 of the Kepler K2 mission have identified 1,957 high-velocity subdwarfs that are nearby members of the Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, to identify and characterize a statistically significant number of the first generation of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars."

The closest systems are quite easy to study from the ground, but Kepler observations have opened the door for precise studies of the population of systems with periods between 0.5 and and 10 days.

Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission. The excellent Kepler light curves show photometric signals from Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal deformations and mutual irradiation effects. Long-cadence K2 observations presents us with an unique opportunity to accumulate a larger sample of post-common envelope sdB binaries that can shed light on the statistics of the CEE process, and thereby constrain the long sought after efficiency parameters that govern the common envelope stage of evolution.

The initial Kepler field contained very few (only 4) distant and/or old clusters. The stellar content and cluster properties of nearby open clusters has already been well characterized from ground-based and some space-based multicolour photometric and spectroscopic observations. Here we propose to discover and characterize stellar variability in about 2700 probable cluster members of the four nearby open clusters accessible in Kepler 2 Fields 4 and 5: The Pleiades and Hyades (Field 4) and Praesepe and M67 (Field 5). Our primary goal is discover and refine the pulsation properties of mid and upper main-sequence variables (gamma Doradus, delta Scuti, and slowly pulsating B stars) having periods of hours to days accessible by long-cadence observations. Asteroseismology for these objects to date is limited by the number of modes observable from the ground and 1 c/d aliasing problems, difficulty in obtaining spectroscopic or photometric mode ID for the fainter variables that have been discovered/observed by Kepler, uncertainties in interior and initial abundances, especially for stars with abundance anomalies, uncertainties in distance/luminosity, and lack of knowledge of prior evolution history. We also target blue stragglers, A-F type stars with peculiar abundances that may or may not show pulsations, stars on the lower main sequence that may show variability due to rotating star spots or magnetic activity, binaries that may have one or more pulsating components. The constraints of common age, distance and initial abundances in clusters will place these stars in their evolutionary context, and help unlock some of the science questions and reduce uncertainties for understanding star formation and stellar evolution."

GO5050,5,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transits,"Although only 2% of stars evolve through the subdwarf B (sdB) phase (e.g. Heber 2009 ARA&A 47, 211 and refs. therein), there are at least two good reasons to study sdB planets/BDs: i) to date very little is known on the late-stage evolution of planetary systems. No detections yet around single white dwarfs (e.g. Hogan et al. 2009, MNRAS 396, 2074). Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and AGB (Villaver & Livio 2009, ApJ 705, L81; Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ, 761, 121; Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). Observational constraints are essential to test the models. SdB planets offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion and PN ejection).

ii) The envelope ejection needed to form an sdB star is well explained in terms of close binary evolution for half of the sdBs that have a close stellar companion (Han et al. 2002, MNRAS 336, 449; 2003, MNRAS 341, 669), but is more problematic for the other half of apparently single sdB stars. The presence of close massive planets or BDs is a possible explanation (Soker 1998,AJ 116, 1308; Han et al. 2012, PASP Conf. Series 452, 3).

In the last 7 years the first planet/BD candidates around sdB stars were detected (Silvotti et al. 2014, ASP Conf. Series 481, 13).

In particular, during its primary mission (K1), Kepler has detected two planetary systems around KIC05807616 (Charpinet et al. 2011, Nature 480, 496) and KIC10001893 (Silvotti et al. 2014, A&A in press) from illumination photometric variations, i.e. reflection/re-emission of the stellar light.

These planets (or planetary remnants) have Earth-like radii and are in very tight orbits. Previously they must have been engulfed by the RG envelope of the sdB precursor. Based on these discoveries, from statistical considerations it comes out that 1 out of ~40 single sdB stars is expected to show a planetary transit.

A similar number (1 out of ~25) is obtained independently from a small sample of 27 bright single-lined sdB stars showing small RV variations, that can be associated with massive sub-stellar companions (Geier et al. 2012, ASP Conf. Series, 452, 153).

The main goal of this proposal is to detect first sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targeting in SC ~40-50 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. SC is required as the typical transit duration of a close planet with 6h<P_orb<24h is 15 to 40 min. The transit depth varies between a 25% occultation for a Jovian planet down to 0.2% for Earth-like planets (assuming a typical sdB radius of 0.2 R_Sun). Given the high number of transits in a ~75 days run, K2 should be able to measure objects with a radius smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, in 1-3 years from now PEPSI@LBT and EXPRESSO@VLT may be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.

The secondary goal of this proposal is to find more Jovian/BD companions to sdB stars in tight orbits through illumination effects and increase the statistics of these objects. With ~2.5 months of data companions with Jovian radii are easily detectable. This secondary goal is compatible with LC data. LC data will also allow to increase the statistics of sdB faint stellar companions (WD or M-dwarf) through reflection/re-emission, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting; and to find new g-mode sdB pulsators and study them through asteroseismology."

In particular, radial velocity surveys such as those executed by HARPS and HIRES yield the planetary mass, assuming the host star is well-characterized. However, radial velocity surveys are inefficient, as they require relatively large amounts of large telescope time, and instruments observe only one star at a time. Proper target selection is therefore critical to maximize the probability of success. Typically search programs focus on relatively bright (V < 12) mid-G to early M dwarfs, excluding known active stars and spectroscopic binaries. This proposal takes advantage of the capabilities of K2 to greatly improve target selection and the resulting exoplanet detection rate, through the use of a technique which allows us to preferentially select systems with large values of sini based on photometry alone.  We propose to observe all lower main sequence stars (Teff = 2700-6500 K ) with V < 12 in both K2 fields 4 and 5. This amounts to approximately 4000 targets in each field. Our expected scientific outcomes are: 1. Identification of the best targets in these K2 fields for future planet searches.
2. Improved data on stellar rotation and activity as functions of metallicity and other fundamental parameters for our target stars. The use of different fields than the original Kepler FOV will enable sampling new portions of the stellar population of the Galaxy.

Such stars are overrepresented among the host stars of planets, especially those small planets with moderate equilibrium temperatures,  detected by the Kepler mission.  However, the possible dynamical and physical evolution of planets in the compact habitable zones around M dwarfs is poorly understood.  Because such stars evolve slowly after reaching the main sequence, it is difficult to assign ages to M dwarf planet systems and investigate changes with time.  M dwarfs in coeval moving groups of known age can be studied, and the rotation and activity of those stars used to construct a gyrochronology to assign ages to other M dwarfs in the field.    We propose K2 observations of 2121 M dwarf stars in the Campaign 4 and 5 fields that are confirmed or candidate members of the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe clusters.  The members of these clusters have ages of about 120, 650, and 600 Myr, respectively.  We include candidates in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog identified as M dwarfs in the recent published literature, as well as stars with matching colors and magnitudes, and proper motions permissive of the stars being dwarfs.  We propose long cadence observations to identify candidate transiting planets on short-period orbits and determine the stellar rotational periods in the resulting light curves.  We will carry out a vigorous campaign of ground-based observations to estimate the fundamental stellar parameters (effective temperature, metallicity, radius, luminosity, and mass) of these stars and use comparisons with a stellar evolution model, and estimates of distance, age, and radial velocity to assess the likelihood of membership of each star in any of the clusters.  We will use archival ultraviolet and X-ray observations from space mission to determine the high-energy radiation from these stars, and propose additional X-ray observations if appropriate.

The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density (PSD) on timescales from minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars.

One or two detections will confirm the deficiency at 2-3 sigma level. More than two detections are deemed as unlikely given the Kepler main mission result.  Targeting binary stars with no prior information of planet helps to unambiguously address the planet occurrence rate in binary stars. Increasing the sample size helps not only to confirm the deficiency of planets in binary stars but also study the influence of stellar companions on planets with different sizes and orbital separations. Future NASA mission in search of habitable worlds will inevitably encounter with this question: to select binary stars or not, which account for 33% of stars in the solar neighborhood. This proposal will pave the way to solve this question."

Some of them should correspond to the post-EHB evolutionary stage and consequently were former sdB stars. However many seem to have other unclear origins. During a recent survey for pulsations in field sdO stars, we noticed that our precision light curves for many sdO stars sometimes exhibited very small, irregular variations on time scales of several minutes to several tens of minutes (Green et al. 2014). Repeated observations on several of them even captured unexpected drops in luminosity by up to 0.05-0.10 mag, during which their light flickered irregularly in a manner reminiscent of the light from accretion disks in cataclysmic variables. This suggests the presence of accretion disks analogous to those in VY Scl stars. The small luminosity variations we observed in a number of other sdO stars indicate that they too could occasionally be capable of similar larger luminosity variations, and thus accretion disks might be associated with a significant number of sdO stars. However, the structure of such sdO systems is not at all clear. Kepler 2 provides a unique and much welcomed opportunity to monitor sdO stars present in the selected fields. The long time baseline and uninterrupted high precision photometric data of K2 will be critical for characterizing these puzzling phenomena and provide answers concerning their possible origin."

At the same time, they are powerful standard candles for extragalactic and cosmological studies. They are key tools for stellar astrophysics for exploring connections between pulsation, mass loss, convection and rotation, as well as tracers of stellar populations and clusters. In the next decade, Cepheids will be employed to measure the Hubble constant to a precision of 1% using the James Webb Space Telescope, WFIRST and GAIA. To achieve these goals, uninterrupted, high-precision photometric measurements of Cepheids with the Kepler space telescope will be crucial, in order to understand the details of their light variations.

Cepheids are rare beasts in the Galaxy. So far, very few members were observed by space photometric missions: the original Kepler field, for example contained a single Type I star only. Observing every known and candidate Cepheids in the K2 mission will greatly enhance our understanding of these important stars. Our research goals include the understanding of period jitter and its connection to stellar evolution and pulsation, and to probe the effects of convection and granulation on Cepheid light curves. Observing the smaller, older Type II Cepheids will help us to gain insight into the formation theories of these stars. Field stars will also allow for a unique opportunity to compare their K2 light curves with extragalactic Cepheids that will be potentially observable in future K2 Fields. In order to meet these goals, a systematic survey of all known and suspected Cepheids in all K2 fields is required.

We identified eight Cepheid candidates in Field 4 and four in Field 5 of the K2 mission. Most of these stars are rather unknown, small-amplitude variable stars, promising to explore the limits of radial pulsation and test whether the previously-detected period jitter is ubiquitous, and if it is a result of surface convection or pulsation instabilities. We propose to observe all stars in long-candence mode.

Our team consists of members of the Working Group#7 (RR Lyrae and Cepheids) of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, who have been working on Kepler data since the launch of the mission. Thus, we have scientists who are experts on data reduction, pixel photometry, light curve and time-frequency analysis. Our team also consists of theorists with expertise in hydrodynamic, stellar evolution and stellar atmosphere modeling. Space-based photometry will be accompanied with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic observations to classify all proposed targets, select the bona-fide Cepheids and determine their fundamental parameters."

Variability is often caused by magnetic activity and, as such, it has an apparently stochastic nature. This is why the impact of activity on photometry or radial velocities is often referred to as _x005F_x005Fjitter_x005F_x005F and treated as a noise source. But this approach is just a consequence of our lack of knowledge of how stellar magnetic activity works. If understood in sufficient detail, one could turn the supposed _x005F_x005Fnoise_x005F_x005F into _x005F_x005Fsignal_x005F_x005F and therefore correct it out. A particularly interesting possibility is to use simultaneous photometry and precision radial velocities to break some of the degeneracy and better constrain the reconstruction of the stellar surface, as well as studying parameter correlations. This was put to practice for the active planet host star HD 189733 with relatively good success but also highlighting the need to expand the test to other stars with extended time baselines and coverage density. K2 long-cadence photometry, in simultaneous combination with radial velocities from the ground, offers a unique opportunity to contribute critical information to the better modelling of stellar activity and subsequent correction of precise photometry and RVs for exoplanet discovery and measurement.

Our strategy comprises the selection of stars with moderate activity level in the K2 fields. Field 4 is particularly interesting since it covers part of the Hyades cluster, whose GK member stars are relatively bright and have the appropriate activity levels. Using several criteria we have selected V=7.5-8.5 mag G-type stars with log R_x005F_x005FHK around -4.5 in Field 4 and Field 5. The precise photometry from K2 will be complemented with ground-based RVs from the HARPS-N, TRES, and SOPHIE instruments to which the proposers have direct access and deliver measurements with precisions better than a few m/s. This will allow us to obtain simultaneous RV measurements for the targets, at a rate of one measurement per night, and for a time baseline of about 40-50 days. This represents several rotation cycles of the targets as they are expected to rotate with periods of ~10 days. The combination of K2 data and ground-based RV measurements is key to further our understanding of stellar activity and to turning a _x005F_x005Fnoise_x005F_x005F component into correctable _x005F_x005Fsignal_x005F_x005F, thus opening the way for the discovery of smaller exoplanets (using both photometry and spectroscopy) and for the eventual measurement of the minute signature of their atmospheres. Combining precise ground-based spectroscopy and space-based photometry of bright stars will be commonplace in the near future with the TESS mission. This proposal therefore represents a case study for such upcoming investigations."

A significant fraction of the sdB stars develop rich nonradial oscillations involving both p and g-modes making them privileged targets for deep asteroseismic probing, provided that high quality photometric data can be obtained. With this proposal, we intend to exploit all the opportunities arising with K2 to obtain very high precision seismic data for these pulsating stars whenever possible. These, combined with data obtained during the Kepler 1 mission, will be extremely valuable to secure a representative enough sample of sdB stars with deep asteroseismic information on their internal structure available. Our team is expert in analyzing and modeling pulsating sdB stars and we have developed efficient tools to interpret the embedded seismic information (see eg Van Grootel et al. 2013, A&A, 553, 97 and references therein).

These objects are excellent galactic structure tracers and distance indicators, therefore understanding their dynamics _x005F_x005F and their optical behavior _x005F_x005F is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. We plan to study 87 and 90 RR Lyrae stars in the Fields 4&5 with K2's unique capabilities of providing long, uninterrupted, high-precision space photometry. The sample will be used to conduct galactic structure studies and to improve our understanding of dynamical behavior of RR Lyrae stars. Our immediate objectives are: 1. Study the Galactic structure and history by obtaining distances to RR Lyrae stars and determine their spatial distribution (halo streams, over-densities). During the K2 Mission we will build up a unique database from field to field covering different parts of our Galaxy, to yield an unprecedented photometric RR Lyrae sample which will form the base of galactic structure studies and near-field cosmology. 2. Statistical analysis of various dynamical phenomena (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko-modulation, period-doubling, low-dimensional chaos, nonradial modes) and their occurrence rates to better understand their origin and their effect on distance determination. This can only be accomplished with K2. 3. Analyze in detail all RR Lyrae light curves, especially overtone and classical double-mode pulsators. The original Kepler field contained no RRd stars, and only a few RRc. This will aid the investigation of dynamical phenomena (resonances, mode interactions) that may be important in other types of pulsating stars, but can be best studied only in large-amplitude stars and with space photometry. After producing light curves from target pixel data we apply standard time-frequency analysis and study  time-dependent features. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes and ground-based follow-up observations will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models  will be computed to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations. The proposed project will provide a unique opportunity to better understand these highly variable classical pulsating stars on the horizontal branch and their role in unraveling the formation of our Galaxy."

The tidal disruption of a close binary by the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic center was suggested as their origin. Most of the known HVSs are of late B spectral type. Therefore, their evolutionary state is still ambigious - either they are distant, massive (2-4 solar masses) main sequence stars or closer, low mass blue horizontal branch stars.

To achieve the full 6D phase space information their distances need to be known accurately. With Kepler light curves it will be possible to detect the low amplitude, slow variability indicative of a slowly pulsating main sequence star.

In addition, inconsistencies between time of flight and evolutionary lifetime occured, which call for ejection scenarios involving triple systems and mergers. Such a triple could be ejected as a HVS binary through interactions with the SMBH in the Galactic Center. The discovery of such a binary could explain the appearence of young stars in the distant Galactic halo by rejuvenation through merging. But much more close HVS binaries are predicted to exist than mergers. The K2 mission will enable us to search for close companions via eclipses, reflection effects from a cool companion or ellipsoidal deformations of the primary caused by a white dwarf companion predicted by models of the triple ejection scenario."

A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets.  It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come.  I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 light years (or 30.7 pc).  The sample is expected to be less than 30 targets, and they may be observed with the long cadence.  While the probability of a detection of a planet in such a small sample is low, given the total sample in all K2 campaigns, it is favorable that such a nearby planetary system will be detected.  If so, it is likely to be one of the most heavily scrutinized systems given the relative ease of follow-up observations.  This not only applies to the planetary properties (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements, astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements), but also the stellar properties (e.g., metallicity, activity, wind strength), and even the circumstellar (e.g., debris disk, exozodical emission) and surrounding interstellar properties.  For example, stellar winds are critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres, even when they are relatively weak, like those of solar-like stars.  The only method of measuring such winds is through the interaction of the interstellar medium and the stellar wind, which creates an astrosphere.  This requires some knowledge of the surrounding interstellar medium and stellar properties, and has only been successful for very nearby stars.  Therefore, given its proximity, a planet found in the proposed sample of nearby stellar systems has the best opportunity to be fully characterized with a comprehensive and robust suite of measurements."

We will eliminate false positives with follow-up Keck AO and measure their masses, a critical parameter for atmospheric modeling, with Yale Keck-HIRES time.  With planets suitable for atmospheric follow-up (i.e., typically planets with large atmospheres), we will use Yale time on a new, near-IR spectrograph, MRO-NESSI, to measure and characterize their atmospheres.  The host star brightness will allow for robust measurements of their pressure-temperature profiles and atmospheric compositions, adding to the extremely small collection of other exoplanets with well-characterized atmospheres orbiting bright stars.  Other potential discoveries include the presence of disequilibrium chemistry and thermal inversions.  A well-characterized exoplanet atmosphere provides important information on planet formation, the planet_x005F_x005Fs structure, and fundamental atmospheric physics, while also providing the crucial building blocks towards future measurements of a habitable, Earth-like planet_x005F_x005Fs atmosphere.

The discovery of the transiting candidates will be made via a transit-finding computer algorithm and by visual inspection of the light curves for this limited set of stars. To engage the public in this search, we will feature these light curves on the citizen science Planet Hunters project (PI: D. Fischer and C. Lintott) to allow our public volunteers to participate in the search for transiting planets.  This project continues Kepler_x005F_x005Fs legacy of discovering and characterizing planets. The ability to complete this project is enabled by Kepler_x005F_x005Fs wide-field, continuous monitoring to achieve precise photometric observations for a large number of stars simultaneously.  The deliverable of this project will be at least one bright, nearby exoplanet with measured atmospheric properties. These bright stars will be prime targets for subsequent studies and may eventually serve as targets for the search for life on other planets."

The transit of an Earth-sized planet could cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations.  While no white dwarf is currently known to have a transiting object, there are several indications that planetary material is present in orbit around white dwarfs, including detected debris disks and observations of accreted material in the atmosphere of the white dwarf.  The fact that we do not have a detection of a transiting object around a white dwarf may not be due to the intrinsic physical properties of the white dwarf star and its formation, but the small numbers of searched systems.  While small in number (we anticipate less than 50 targets per campaign), the accumulation of sources over the entire K2 mission is significant to detect or place strong limits on planets around white dwarfs.  These observations would be sensitive to small planetary objects (including asteroids) in a wide range of orbits, including throughout the habitable zone of the white dwarf in which orbital periods range from 4-32 hours.  A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates.  Indeed, given the small size of the host star, atmospheric characterization of terrestrial planets is much simpler if transiting a white dwarf than a solar-like star.  Therefore, in the coming decades our strongest constraints on biomarkers in terrestrial planets may very well come from a planet in orbit around a white dwarf."

We propose to do an asteroseismic study of stars in these clusters using solar-type oscillators.
 While all four clusters have been well studied, most depend on isochrone fitting to determine cluster properties. The properties therefore depend on the assumed distance to the cluster and the extinction too. Asteroseismic studies will allow us to determine properties of the cluster that do not depend on the distances and are only indirectly dependent on the extinction.  Since these stars in each cluster should have a very small spread of ages and metallicities, an ensemble study of these stars will also allow us to test different aspects of the theory of stellar structure and evolution.
 The targets of our study are predominantly main-sequence and subgiant stars. Consequently, all our targets need to be observed in the short cadence.  The proposal team covers all the expertise needed: time series analysis, peak-bagging to determine frequencies, asteroseismic analyses of the frequencies, expertise on rotation and stellar activities which might make interpretation difficult as well as abundance analyses needed for the complete analysis of the asteroseismic data."

First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies.

Small companions to close-in gas giants are rare, and solar-type stars are known to host large numbers of small planets. Therefore a search around stars that have already been vetted for the presence of close-in gas giants has a high probability of detecting planets small, potentially rocky planets.

The sensitivity of K2 is orders of magnitude better than that of SuperWASP. As such it will be able to find the signatures of small planets that are hiding in the noise on the SuperWASP measurements.

Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence. Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100 AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013). In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star.  Science Goal 2: Provide benchmark gyrochronology systems. Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components. Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars. By including wide binary components as Kepler targets, we will produce a valuable legacy product to test and recalibrate gyrochronology relations allowing the ages of field stars to be more accurately determined.  
We have used the proper motion catalog of Kraus et al. (2014) to select pairs of objects with common proper motion. We have restricted ourselves to objects with significant proper motions above 30 milliarcseconds per year and have also set a condition of common distance (using distance moduli derived from SED fitting). In Fields 4 and 5 we also specifically exclude objects in the Pleiades and Praesepe which could contaminate our sample. We then restricted our sample to pairs which were close enough to make them unlikely to be purely coincident pairings between unrelated field stars. This resulted in 246 targets on silicon in fields 4 and 5.
 Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. We already have 116 targets accepted for Field 1 with 98 targets proposed for Field 3 (Field 2 suffers from crowding making clean target selection difficult). This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity."

For example, we have strong evidence that there is more than one pulsation mechanism at work in Delta Sct stars, showing that convection in the outer envelope can play an important role (Antoci et al. 2011, Antoci et al., submitted). Kurtz et al. (2014) measured for the first time the internal rotation rate for a Delta Sct/Gamma Dor hybrid from examination of splittings of individual oscillation modes.

Here we propose to observe all known pulsators, fainter than 7th magnitude in the V band, of Gamma Dor, Delta Sct, SPB and Be type as well as stars with reliable spectral type identification and atmospheric parameter measurements (v sin i, Teff , log g, ...). Our selected stars are located in clusters that are visible in campaigns 4 and 5. We wish to observe over a hundred of stars in these clusters. The Pleiades, NGC 1647, Hyades, M44 and M67 cover a range of ages (approximately 100 Myr to 4.8 Gyr) and offer _x005F_x005Fsnapshots_x005F_x005F in the life of stars over a range of masses with approximately the same initial chemical composition. All clusters, with the exception of M67, are young enough to harbour pulsating, intermediate-mass stars on or near the main sequence. In the case of M67 the turn-off mass is only slightly higher than the solar one, meaning that all massive stars have evolved off the main sequence. However, this cluster has several known pulsating blue stragglers, which are thought to be the product of mergers or accretion in binary systems. The true origin of these stars is still under debate but studying their oscillations may uncover their formation scenario. For example, the helium content in the merger scenario is higher and this will influence the oscillatory behaviour, which we can measure. In other words the K2 mission can for the first time offer a homogeneous sample of oscillating intermediate-mass stars over a range of well determined ages and chemical compositions.

Work plan: After basic photometric reductions and identification of the pulsation modes, we plan to do an asteroseismic analyses of the light curves and explore their oscillatory behaviour. We will use the asteroseismic results to test the recently suggested driving mechanism proposed by Antoci et al. (submitted), which is related to the turbulent pressure in the stellar envelope. We will also probe the edges of the instability regions in the HR diagram and select the best targets to do theoretical in-depth studies. K2 is the only mission in the near future, to do the science proposed here because it delivers homogeneous observations and long uninterrupted data sets of pulsating stars in clusters with sufficient precision over a large range of magnitudes. We will be able to determine the oscillation frequencies unambiguously even for the stars oscillating with periods shorter than the Nyquist frequency imposed by the LC data, as studied by Murphy et al. (in prep).

To summarize, the combination of homogeneous K2 observations with already available ground-based photometric and spectroscopic data as well as constrains set from cluster ensemble studies and eclipsing binary systems is a unique opportunity to do asteroseismic studies of early-type stars."

We propose a survey of 1648 low-luminosity RGB stars (with radii between ~3.5-8 solar radii) using long-cadence data to detect transiting gas-giant planets with K2. Since RGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with K2 long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planet candidates. The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. This project is the only possibility to realize a K2 survey which systematically combines asteroseismology and transits to precisely characterize exoplanets."
GO5093,5,Mike,D,Reed,Missouri State University,mikereed@missouristate.edu,,Understanding extreme horizontal branch stars via asteroseismology,"We propose to explore core structure of horizontal branch stars by applying asteroseismological tools to Kepler data of extreme horizontal branch (spectral class subdwarf B) stars. Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars. Many happen to pulsate, and that allows us to probe their structure. From Kepler's main mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes and to constrain structure models from period spacings and frequency multiplets.

        Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age since some stars show substantial mode trapping while in others it appears to be absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of different evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models.

        Frequency multiplets also tell us the rotation period and orientation of the pulsation axis. From this information we have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary period down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components.

        We made significant progress from the original Kepler mission. However, to fully exploit those advances, we need to complete the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). It would also be a huge benefit to have more examples of pulsators in binaries, as that allows us to further explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection.

        To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of a selection of likely sdB pulsators and long-cadence (LC) observations of remaining sdB stars. The SC data can fully explore pulsations and short-period (1 day) binaries and while the LC data can detect some pulsations while still exploring binary sdB stars, especially the longer-period ones.

        Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.

        We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include graduate and undergraduate students as signficant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training."
GO5095,5,Marcel,,Agueros,Columbia University,marcel@astro.columbia.edu,"Law, Nicholas M; Kraus, Adam L; Douglas, Stephanie T; Covey, Kevin; Cargile, Phillip A",HyPra: Characterizing the Rotation-Activity Relation At 600 Myr With K2 Light Curves And Ground-Based Spectroscopy,"Forty years ago, Andrew Skumanich proposed that rotation and chromospheric activity, a proxy for magnetic field strength, decrease at roughly the same rate for solar-type stars between the ages of 100 and 500 Myr. The existence of an age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR) has generated hope that measurements of rotation and/or activity can be used to obtain the ages of field stars. Unfortunately, however, a robust, quantitative, theoretically motivated description of the ARAR still eludes us.

Empirical forms of the ARAR rely largely on observations of stars in open clusters: these stars' well-defined ages make them valuable targets for measuring rotation periods and indicators of magnetic activity such as Halpha line strengths and X-ray luminosities. However, ages derived from empirical ARARs rarely have uncertainties better than 50%. Open clusters are relatively rare, particularly at older ages, so that calibrating the ARAR between a few 100 Myr and the age of the Sun is difficult. And until recently, there was little overlap between the clusters used to measure periods and those used to measure activity. Rotation studies often focused on distant clusters, whose smaller angular sizes maximize the number of stars whose periods can be measured efficiently with multi-epoch imaging of a few fields. Activity studies targeted nearby clusters, for which high signal-to-noise data can be obtained with single-object spectroscopy or in all-sky X-ray surveys.

Over the last several years, we have engaged in a large-scale campaign to systematically map out rotation and activity in open clusters ranging in age from 35 Myr to 3 Gyr. Our focus is on calibrating the ARAR for low-mass stars, which dominate most stellar populations by number and have lifetimes exceeding the age of the Galaxy. As every low-mass star formed in the Milky Way still resides on the main sequence, using an improved ARAR to derive reliable ages for these stars would provide invaluable insight into the chemical evolution and star formation history of the Galaxy. Furthermore, the first habitable Earth-like planet is likely to be discovered around an old, low-mass field star: understanding this planet's radiation environment and current habitability will require an improved ARAR that can be applied to its parent star. Currently, however, we must invert the process, adopting canonical ages for the field-star population to constrain the ARAR Recently, we examined the relationship between activity and rotation in the Hyades and Praesepe, two benchmark, roughly 600-Myr-old clusters. Because these are two of the nearest, best-studied open clusters, empirical calibrations of the ARAR often interpolate directly between the observed properties of their members (and particularly of Hyads) and those of the Sun. We found that the Hyades and Praesepe follow an identical color-activity, and therefore age-activity, relation, implying that we can use the merged HyPra sample to characterize stellar properties at 600 Myr (Douglas et al. 2014).

We propose to obtain K2 light curves for every accessible HyPra member. The K2 campaign is an extraordinary opportunity to complete the sample of period measurements for stars in these two clusters, providing access to longer, lower-amplitude signals than can currently be measured from the ground. In addition, the K2 campaign will allow us to disentangle real stellar variability from some of the systematic effects that plague ground-based period measurements. Combining the K2 data with existing and new spectroscopy, we will provide new constraints on the operation of stellar dynamos and calibrate a valuable tool for age-dating stars and exoplanets. This proposal therefore directly supports NASA's goal of understanding exoplanetary systems."

Concurrent with the K2 observations, we will observe our K2 targets with ground-based facilities. When a SN appears in the field, we will issue a trigger to a large community of SN observers to obtain additional spectra and multi-color data sets. In combination with the K2 data, these SNe will be some of the best observed SN events, and these data will lead to: 1) a significant improvement in our understanding of the explosion mechanism of supernovae, 2) better calibration of SNe and therefore better luminosity distances for cosmological studies and 3) better constraints on the equation of state of dark energy."

Ground-base monitoring of short-term variations are strongly limited by weather and the diurnal cycle, while long-term monitoring is effected by seasonal observing windows.  Kepler permits monitoring of galaxies which is sensitive to both continuous variability, especially millimag-level variations from embedded active nuclei and random episodic events, such as supernovae and accretion events induced by tidal disruption of stars orbiting near a SMBH.  The primary objectives of this proposal are (a) to expand the baseline of time-domain observations of galactic systems with emphasis on galaxy types not well represented in the Kepler and previous K2 campaigns; (b) quantify the frequency of and amplitude of optical AGN signals in galaxy cores, both quasi-continuous and episodic, and (c) provide a direct measure of supernovae rates across galaxy types, focusing on starburst systems.  The reduced sensitivity expected in the K2 campaign still opens up parameter space not accessible from the ground for the topics described above.  Goal (b) and (c) are statistical in nature, in which the desire for very large samples to improve detection statistics must be balanced against overall target availability and competing science in each campaign.  Measuring the frequency of AGN signals informs on the widely accepted but unproven paradigm that all galaxies contain a central supermassive black hole whose mass scales roughly with the total galaxy mass. For goal (c) we will emphasis starburst systems to improve the odds of detecting the initial light from multiple Type II supernovae.

One method of stellar age determination, gyrochronology, relies on the color and rotation period of a star; rotation rate offers direct insight into the evolution of stellar angular momentum and decreases with stellar age. Previous studies have found that wide binaries are an ideal sample for constraining gyrochronology models and are particularly useful for age-dating older and low-mass stars (i.e., where empirical methods of age determination are most needed). Using the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog and the fourth U.S. Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog, we identified 9786 common proper motion binaries in K2 Fields 4 and 5 and will use long-cadence observations of a subset of these pairs to measure photometric rotation periods and recalibrate the age-rotation relationship. Additionally, given well-determined ages for a sample of binaries with attending planets, we can also extrapolate planetary ages and begin to constrain planet formation and evolution scenarios using an absolute timescale."

In the next few years, multiple instruments on 8-10m class telescopes will be upgraded or commissioned from scratch to reach the ~1 m/s in the infrared RV measurement precision necessary to detect habitable Earth-mass planets around nearby M dwarfs. However, with this considerable effort and potential telescope time being placed on detecting such light-weight planets, it is critical that we invest some effort in learning as much as possible about the atmospheric characteristics of the planet host target stars _x005F_x005F the M dwarfs. Indeed, there is still much to be learned about the interiors and atmospheres of the most populous star in the galaxy. There are still inconsistencies between measured radii and those predicted be stellar models. Also, we have much to learn about the interplay between the convective and magnetically driven processes that affect the light curves and RV measurements obtained for these popular planet search targets. Therefore, the goal of this K2 proposal is to utilize the ultra-precise photometry attainable with Kepler to study their granulation properties and to search for correlations between light curve properties and the RV jitter which prevents the detection of Earth-mass planets."

While M dwarfs offer some unique advantages, it is important to search for, characterize and understand exoplanets smaller than Neptune around stars closer in spectral type to our own. We propose to use K2 to carry out a search for transits of small planets around bright F, G and K stars.

	Small planets in such systems will be well suited to follow-up with radial velocity in order to determine their masses thanks to the brightness of the host stars. Stars with spectral types from late F to K should have sufficiently low vsini values, but also lower activity levels than M stars, therefore being ideal for RV measurements. They will also be suitable targets for atmospheric studies, and will make up a valuable sample for understanding how the structures, atmospheric compositions and orbital properties of these planets vary as a function of stellar spectral type. Ultimately, these measurements will enable us to constrain the formation and evolution of these planetary systems.

Target selection and expected yield: For our target selection, we began with all stars from the EPIC that fall on silicon during campaigns 4 and 5. We only kept stars with Kepler magnitudes brighter than 12 to ensure the ability to obtain mass determinations for the expected small transiting planets using high resolution spectrographs such as HARPS and HIRES. These systems will also be sufficiently bright to be accessible to current and upcoming space telescopes such as the HST, Spitzer, JWST and CHEOPS. Using a B-V colour cut, we then filtered out stars of types earlier than mid-F (B-V < 0.5) and later than M (B-V > 1.4). We further removed likely giants and subgiants by filtering out stars with proper motions smaller than 4 mas/yr. Our final sample of targets includes 2408 and 2835 stars in campaigns 4 and 5, respectively.  	From occurrence studies based on Kepler statistics of small planets around FGK stars, we expect to discover of the order of 100 new small planets during campaigns 4 and 5 as part of this survey.

Methodology: The majority of the targets we propose will be saturated. However, it has been demonstrated on both Kepler and K2 data that high-precision photometry is achievable even for saturated stars by using larger, customized apertures to ensure collection of all the light bled down columns and into adjacent pixels. We will use a similar method to extract photometry for saturated stars. Because centroiding will be difficult for those targets, we will use the pixel position of a nearby star to de-correlate the pixel position from the target photometry, an important step in analysing K2 data.

Relevance to ROSES 2014 and K2 GO - Cycle 1 solicitations: This proposal addresses the following NASA and K2 objectives and motivations: understand how small exoplanets form and determine the incidence of planets able to support life in the Universe. Specifically, this program will provide numerous bright systems hosting small planets amenable to follow-up studies that, together with the K2 data, will place constraints on their formation. It will also assess the composition and diversity of small planets around solar-type stars, thereby contributing to our understanding of how common life is in the Universe."

Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. Indeed, eclipsing binary systems allow for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, which can then be compared with asteroseismic estimates. Eclipsing binaries are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough. So far, all the published stars known to both display solar-like oscillations and belong to eclipsing binaries are red-giants, and all have been detected by the Kepler mission (Hekker et al. 2010, Gaulme et al. 2013 & 2014, Beck et al. 2014). The purpose of this GO proposal is to observe a small set of eclipsing binaries, including either a red-giant or a main-sequence solar-like star, that are already well characterized in terms of physical parameters (orbits, masses, radii). Doing so present two main advantages. Firstly, observing well-known systems helps predicting the likelihood of detecting solar-like oscillations. Secondly, the objective is to reduce the burden of ground-based follow-up, which is very time-consuming when radial-velocities need to be measured."

Given their short orbital periods, building the requisite signal-to-noise to detect the candidates by stacking multiple transits requires a much shorter observational baseline than for longer-period planets, and the transits are likely more robust than those of longer-period planets. Likewise, ground-based follow-up to study the host stars spectrally and estimate the planets' masses via radial-velocity measurements require only modest resources. In this proposal, we briefly describe our plans for using K2 photometry to find more very short-period planets orbiting Sun-like stars and to follow them up with ground-based spectral observations. We request data for 999 targets, split between campaigns 4 and 5, making this a ``small'' proposal, and we will focus especially on involving students in the research. Given the estimated frequencies of very short-period planets, we expect to find between 5 and 10 such objects -- a small enough number that a dedicated ground-based follow-up program is imminently feasible but still scientifically compelling."

Kepler  observations revealed that several systems with Algol-like light curves display unequal brightness at their quadrature phases and that the quadrature brightness ratio varies from  > 1 to <1 on a time scale of about 100-400 days. We call these binaries L/T (Leading/Trailing hemisphere) variables. This behavior has never been reported in Algol light curves from ground-based photometry.  Some of the L/T systems show delta Scuti-like pulsations on the primary. From the new observations of Algols in K2 Fields 4 and 5, we will investigate the prevalence of the L/T phenomenon in short-period systems and look for the behavior in longer-period Algols in which the gas stream misses the primary star. The L/T phenomenon is likely a result of star spot activity.  If the L/T variations are due to hot accretion spots, the L/T phenomenon is a diagnostic of stream behavior (either from normal  hydrodynamic flow resulting in shock heating in a direct-impact scenario or impact from a magnetically-controlled stream from the secondary). If the L/T changes are the result of variations in size and distribution of cool spots on the secondary, we gain information on the surface magnetic activity on the mass loser. We propose short cadence observations of the well-known totally-eclipsing system S Cancri from which we can study flare and spot variability on the secondary and variability in its extended atmosphere that is visible just before/just after totality. Pulsation frequencies and behavior will be extracted from the data to compare with Kepler observations of L/T variables.  The K2 light curves will be modeled with the newest version of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) program (Wilson 2012) that includes the treatment of variable/migrating star spots.  Stellar and spot parameters are determined.  K2 provides the continuous photometric coverage of high precision that allows one to identify L/T binaries and study the L/T phenomenon, as the variations are less than 3% of the quadrature flux.  A continuous train of eclipse data over many orbital cycles is needed to characterize the variability, including degree of the flux variations and its phase dependence. The project will yield information on the detailed physics of mass transfer, especially the roles of accretion hot spots and magnetic fields, and also test the new WD program (that will be made available to the community) for future applications by others working with the K2 database."

However, they have stronger fluxes in the nIR. Planets as small as the Earth will cause transits with depths of 0.5-2%. The CARMENES instrument is expected to start operations at the end of 2015. It is a stabilized optical+infrared spectrograph covering from 0.5 to 1.7 microns at R=82,000, whose Doppler precision is at 1 m/s level and will use 600 nights of GTO time at the 3.5m Calar Alto telescope between 2015 and 2018). Such precision and amount of telescope time will allow for the systematic detection of Earth-mass planets in the HZ of low mass stars. M dwarfs, even appearing faint at optical wavelengths (e.g. V,r' ~ 14-18 mag), have sufficient flux in the optical red and nIR to attain the m/s precision. We kindly request to the K2 team to observe as many late type M stars in fields 4 & 5 as possible. This proposal contains a sample of mid to late M-stars that we could identify. Several planet candidates have been reported in the original Kepler field but they tend to be early type M stars (M0V to M3V, Muirhead et al. 2012 ApJ, Dressing & Charbonneau 2013 ApJ, Martin et al. 2013 A&A). As a result, not much is gained in the red-nIR in terms of flux and follow-up is difficult, if not impossible, with current means such as HARPS-N. Raw pixel-level photometry will be analyzed using the SARS pipeline, and light curves will be searched for planet candidates using Optimal Boxed-Least-Squares (Ofir 2013, A&A). All stars will be analized for rotation periods and characteristics of their noise properties (time-scales of correlated noise, flare rates, etc.). Assuming the range of likely densities, Doppler amplitudes will be estimated and targets with enough predicted signal will be followed-up with CARMENES. Comfirmation and mass measurements are necessary preliminary steps before attempting spectroscopic characterization with near-future NASA's telescopes (HST and Spitzer but especially JWST).

Measurement of rotation modulation (or even upper limits to photometric amplitude variations) will further exploit those data to teach us about magnetic fields in these stars that are otherwise inaccessible observationally.

GO6002,6,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,bod21@cam.ac.uk,"Gillon, Michael; Huber, Daniel; Queloz, Didier Patrick",Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types from M0 to L8, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such an exoplanet has not been discovered yet. As of today, K2 is the only facility that provides the required stability and photometric precision to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0, 1, 2 and 3 observations.

SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.

High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).

RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.

METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 6 and 7, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on the M-dwarf bright star catalog of Lepine & Gaidos in one hand and a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series. The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on the K2 engineering data of February 2014 and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program. We already found several planet candidates in that dataset.

EXPECTED YIELD. Our target list is still in preparation. We expect to assemble a list of 110 to 190 bright ultra-cool dwarfs for fields 6 and 7. 

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."
GO6003,6,Mukremin,,Kilic,University of Oklahoma,kilic@ou.edu,"Loeb, Abraham; Agol, Eric; Mullally, Fergal; Debes, John Henry",A Search for Habitable Planets Around White Dwarfs in Fields 6 and 7,"The search for planets in the habitable zone has so far focused on solar-type stars and M dwarfs. However, transiting planets in the habitable zone around white dwarfs (WDs) may be common (Agol 2011, ApJ, 731, L31) and they provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on an exoplanet (Loeb & Maoz 2013, MNRAS, 432, L11). The habitable zone around WDs extends from 0.005 AU to 0.02 AU (P = 4-30 h, Agol 2011) for WDs older than about 1 Gyr. Since WDs are slightly larger than Earth, Earth-size and even smaller planets can easily be detected. We expect the planets within 1 AU of solar type stars to be destroyed in the giant phase. Hence, planets in the habitable zone around WDs must arrive there after this phase. There are several ways to form such planets near the WD or bring them closer (see the Kepler white paper by our team; arXiv:1309.0009). Planets have been detected around evolved, post-main-sequence stars. In addition, tidally disrupted asteroids and dwarf planets have been detected around 4.3% of WDs in the form of debris disks (Barber et al. 2012, ApJ, 760, 26). If the history of exoplanet science has taught us anything, it is that planets are ubiquitous and they exist in the most unusual places, including very close to their host stars and even around pulsars.

Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability of the Kepler 2 mission to perform a transit survey of the WDs in Fields 6 and 7. Using spectroscopy, photometry, and astrometry data from the McCook & Sion White Dwarf catalog, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the SuperCosmos Sky Survey, we identify about 150 WDs in Fields 6 and 7. We propose LC observations of all WD targets.

SC observations would have the best constraints on transiting planets around WDs. However, given the small number of SC slots available, LC mode data will still enable us to achieve our science goals. Planets in the habitable zone would eclipse their stars for about 2 min. Hence, the LC mode data will dilute the transit signal by a factor of 15. However, since the transit depth is >50% for an Earth-size or bigger planet around an average size WD, these transits will have >3% depth in the LC data, and they will still be visible. Even with the decreased sensitivity of the 2wheel mode, Kepler can still detect transits of Earth-size or bigger planets around WDs.

The probability for a transit by an Earth-size planet at 0.01 AU is 1%. Hence, the discovery of habitable planets around WDs requires a survey of at least 100 targets, if all of them have such planets. Previously, we proposed for K2 observations of 560 target WDs in Fields 0-5. The addition of the 150 WDs from Fields 4 and 5 will bring the total number of WDs surveyed by the K2 mission to 700. This survey will provide the first constraints on the frequency of habitable planets around WDs. The survey sample size will grow as the number of observed K2 fields increases. Our proposed survey is relatively cheap due to the relatively small number of WD targets in Fields 6 and 7 . On the other hand, this survey is capable of finding the first planets in the WD habitable zone, and the James Webb Space Telescope is capable of obtaining the first spectroscopic measurements of such planets (Loeb & Maoz 2013).

In addition to the transit search, the 30-min cadence of the LC data is well suited for measuring the rotation periods for a large number of WDs for the first time. WDs have typical rotation periods of a few hours to a few days (Kawaler 2004, IAU #215), though there are only a handful of measurements available. Kepler's precision provides an excellent opportunity to measure the rotation periods for our targets, including the ones with relatively weak magnetic fields (McQuillan et al. 2014, ApJS, 211, 24)."

However, flares from stars much less massive than the Sun are more common. At the start of K2 we initiated a project to observe late type stars with a range of spectral type to determine how the flare activity depended on physical properties such as mass and rotation period and hence gain a better understanding of the underlying physics of flares. Our work will also have implications for determining how flares can effect the habitability of any exoplanets orbiting their parent star. We will select up to a dozen targets in Fields 6 and in 7 and will cover M and early L spectral types. Since some flares can last only a few to tens of mins we will request short cadence mode data for some targets."

condensate clouds in their atmospheres. K2 can unique characterize variability due to these clouds, both rotation modulation on a
timescale of hours and weather evolution of the clouds on timescales from days to months. Magnetic activity changes dramatically
at the stellar/substellar hydrogen-burning limits, but some ultracool dwarfs are known to flare. We will measure the white light
flare rate in well-defined statistical samples as a function of effective temperature, rotation rate, and age. Flares are tied to magnetic
reconnection rates and the energy budget. We also aim to detect transiting exoplanets by continuing to monitor each available
ultracool dwarf in K2 campaigns; brown dwarfs, gas giants, and even large rocky planets are detectable. The K2 targets include nearby field late-M and L dwarfs. The Phase 2 proposal will include fewer than 50 long-cadence targets and  10 short-cadence targets in the two fields."

These deep transits also increase the potential for subsequent atmospheric characterization. The extended Kepler K2 mission provides the opportunity to monitor tens-of-thousands of nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise, long-cadence photometry and discover a new population of rocky and potentially habitable planets and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit spectroscopy. We propose to observe 8006 M dwarfs in the K2 campaign 6 and 7 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate hundreds of small planets around M dwarfs from the full K2-MDP program. This new population of planets will drastically increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems, improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected from the SUPERBLINK proper-motion database on the basis of high proper-motion and photometric colors. This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs within 100pc of the Sun from this deep (95% complete to V =19) catalog with little contamination. Our targets have median brightness Kp<16, most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC. We prioritize our targets using expected transit S/N, determined by comparing K2s photometric precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting super-Earth. We estimate transit depths by converting DSS, PanSTARRS 1, 2MASS, and WISE photometry to spectral type and then to radius and temperature. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date. The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward these goals and draws on considerable experience from Kepler. We have so far had successful target proposals for K2 fields 04 (GOs 0120, 1036, 2107, and 3107), have been awarded a 70- night ESO Large Program for spectroscopic follow-up of candidate planet hosts (PID 194.C-0443) along with many nights of high-precision AO and RV followup at Lick, Palomar, LBT, and Keck.

The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims to exploit the strengths of the K2 mission design to reveal hundreds of small planets around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-like planets and planets suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky planets and key transit spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) leading up to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; months before the launch of TESS."
GO6010,6,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transits,"To date nothing is known about the final (WD) configuration of >95% of planetary systems! While not a single bona-fide planet has been identified orbiting an isolated WD (Faedi+2011,MNRAS 410, 899), it is now widely accepted that the dusty and/or gaseous disks that we see within one solar radius around many WDs are produced by the tidal disruption of asteroids (Farihi+2010, MNRAS 404, 2123). An increasing fraction of WDs (>=27%) show a metal enrichment due to the fall into the WD atmosphere of ancient planetary material (Koester+2014, A&A 566, 34), whose chemical composition is similar to that seen in different Solar-system meteorites (Gansicke et al. 2012, MNRAS 424, 333).
Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and the AGB phases (Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). While Gaia will discover WD planets at several AUs from their host stars, those external to the period gap (Silvotti et al. 2014, arXiv1412.3307), this proposal aims to study the inner boundary of the period gap. Substellar companions to sdB stars offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion, thermal pulses and PN ejection, Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ 761, 121), and they represent the natural 1st step to study the post-RGB evolution of planetary systems and their final architecture. Star/planet interactions during the RGB may be responsible for the stellar envelope ejection leading to the formation of a single sdB star (Soker 1998, AJ 116, 1308; Han+2012, PASP Conf.Ser. 452, 3).
Among 18 planet/BD candidates around sdB stars (Silvotti+2014, ASP Conf.Ser. 481, 13), 2 planetary systems were detected by Kepler measuring the photometric modulation due to reflection/re-emission of the star light (Charpinet+2011, Nature 480, 496; Silvotti+2014, A&A 570, 130). Given that only 15 sdBs were observed by Kepler for enough time to detect tiny photometric variations of 20-50 ppm, we can assume that 2/15 of sdBs have Earth-size bodies in tight orbits at ~0.005 AU from the star. With a geometric transit probability of 0.2 (Rp<<RsdB, RsdB=0.001 AU), the prob. to see a transit is about 0.027, i.e., in average, we need to observe ~40 sdB stars to see one transit. An even higher transit prob. is obtained for the more massive companions detected through RVs: Geier+2012 (ASP Conf.Ser. 452, 153) found that 16% of their sample of 27 single-lined sdBs do show small RV variations compatible with massive substellar companions. Here the geom. transit probability at 0.005 AU is ~0.28 (Rp=0.9 Rjup) so that, in average, 1 sdB out of ~22 should show transits and secondary eclipses.
The main goal of this proposal is to detect sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targetting in SC ~50 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. SC is required as the typical transit duration for a close planet with 6h<Porb<24h is 15 to 40 min. The transit depth may vary between 25% (Jovian radius) down to 0.2% (Earth radius). Given the high number of transits in a ~90 days observation, K2 should be able to measure objects with a radius smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, PEPSI@LBT (which is starting to work this year) and EXPRESSO@VLT (available in 2 years from now) will be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.
The secondary goal of this proposal is to detect photometric variations due to reflection effects by a faint stellar companion, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting. Kepler has already given an important contribution to this field. K2 can increase by a factor 5 to 10 the statistics of well studied sdB+WD and sdB+M-dwarf systems. We point out that the secondary goal is compatible with LC data."

We will compare the properties of the  light curves to those of other Fermi blazars for which we have approved and proposed K2 observations. Eight and six Fermi blazars will be observable with high precision in K2 Campaigns 6 and 7, respectively.  Our scientific goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in these gamma ray blazars at the time of K2 observations. The three candidate origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) substantial contributions from multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk with multiple thermal emitting regions.  We will correct the light curves for motion of the spacecraft using the method of Vanderberg and Johnson (2014 PASP 126, 948). Then we will use our own software developed for Kepler observations to compute power spectral densities and fit power law slopes to the power spectral densities. Our previous Kepler work has been published (Wehrle et al. 2013 ApJ 773, 89;  Revalski et al. 2014 ApJ 785, 60; Carini and Ryle 2012 ApJ 749, 70).  The proposed research is relevant to the K2 Cycle 2 solicitation because we will carry out an investigation of science targets using the high precision photometry of the K2 mission with the goal of understanding the origin of optical emission in the cores of  active galactic nuclei. We address the NASA Astrophysics goal of understanding the nature of black holes in the Universe."

Our goal is to discover new pulsating variables, as well as eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars with variability produced by rotating spots.  We will use colors and magnitudes listed in the EPIC catalog to select main-sequence stars with Kepler magnitude between approximately 8 and 12.   Our selection of stars in this magnitude range will minimize the number of pixels required, yet the stars will be bright enough for ground-based ground-based follow-up observations including high-resolution spectroscopic observations.

Observations by the Kepler spacecraft have turned out to be ideal for discovery and characterization of pulsations of main-sequence stars that pulsate in radial and non-radial pressure and gravity modes.  The long time series and high precision of the photometry have enabled determining the frequencies and amplitudes of the modes with periods of order a day (g modes) to a few hours (p and mixed modes) using long-cadence data (30-min integrations per data point).    Analysis of the Kepler data has raised a number of questions about the possible pulsation driving mechanisms for gamma Doradus g-mode and delta Scuti p-mode pulsations, and revealed a surprising number of hybrid star candidates that show pulsations in both types of modes.  The Kepler data has also been used to study slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars (g-mode pulsators), beta Cephei stars (p-mode pulsators) and their hybrids to test stellar pulsation theory in the presumably simpler case for these hotter stars with smaller envelope convection zones.  The analysis has also identified a number of apparently non-pulsating stars that lie within the pulsation instability regions established by theory that need to be explained.  We expect to increase the numbers of these types of stars available for detailed study, especially for candidates brighter than those found in the original Kepler field.   We also expect to discover additional eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars.  

Our sample selection will not be biased toward known pulsators, and will include enough stars to derive statistics of the occurrence of variability.  We will compare our results with similar surveys of stars in the original Kepler Cygnus-Lyra field, and with surveys of stars in young open clusters for K2 Fields 0-5.   We will also produce a catalog of all of the candidate variables, eclipsing binaries, and magnetically active stars that we find."
GO6018,6,John,,Southworth,Keele University,astro.js@keele.ac.uk,"Mancini, Luigi; Hellier, Coel",High-precision photometry of Qatar-2 and WASP-55: the two currently known transiting planets in K2 field 6,"The study of extrasolar planets is a young field but already represents one of the major scientific advances of the 21st century, due in particular to the remarkable results achieved during the main mission of the Kepler satellite. Of the known extrasolar planets, only those which transit their host stars can be characterised in detail. For these objects, analysis of photometry and spectroscopy can yield measurements of their masses and radii, and thus densities and surface gravities, enabling studies of the structure, formation and evolution of planets and planetary systems.

The K2 mission field 6 contains two known transiting extrasolar planets: Qatar-2 and WASP-55. Both are gas-giant planets in short-period orbits (1.3 and 4.5 days respectively) whose masses and radii have been measured to precisions of between 2% and 10% from ground-based observations. Detailed error budgets from past studies of transiting planets have shown that the quality of the light curve is the main determinant of the precision of the measured properties of the system (e.g. Southworth, 2009, MNRAS, 394, 272), especially for density and surface gravity. 

Qatar-2 is also known to show strong spot activity in the parent star: an extensive ground-based study based on 17 transit light curves found spot-crossing events in all of the transits (Mancini et al., 2014, MNRAS, 443, 2391). These were used to measure the orbital obliquity of the system to high precision, further informing theories of the formation of planetary systems. 

We propose to observe Qatar-2 and WASP-55 with Kepler K2 in short cadence. We will use the light curves to measure the physical properties of both systems to very high precision, using the methodology we have developed over the past 8 years (see Southworth, 2012, MNRAS, 426, 1291 and references therein) and a K2 data reduction pipeline currently being developed by our group. Short-cadence data is mandatory to resolve the spot crossing events in the transits of Qatar-2, which have a characteristic timescale of approximately 15 minutes. For WASP-55, short-cadence data is necessary to obtain a measurement of the planet's density to 2-3% precision (long cadence observations would only give a precision of 5-6%), which is needed to usefully constrain the internal structure of a planet of this mass (see Fortney et al., 2007, ApJ, 659, 1661)."
GO6019,6,Peter,I,Papics,Instituut voor Sterrenkunde,Peter.Papics@ster.kuleuven.be,"Briquet, Maryline; Aerts, Conny Clara; De Cat, Peter",Internal Mixing Processes and Angular Momentum Transport in Pulsating B-type Stars on the Main Sequence,"Stellar lifetime is strongly influenced by internal mixing processes, such as core overshooting and rotation. These effects, and their precise dependency on the presence of magnetic fields or their contribution to the transport of angular momentum and chemical species are poorly known. This lack of understanding results in uncertainties on current stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars. Because many studies within modern astrophysics rely on precise predictions of these models, such as chemical enrichment of galaxies, age determination of the Universe, stellar life cycles and their effect on star and planetary system formation, dynamics within stellar clusters, etc., these uncertainties need to be resolved.

Asteroseismology is one of the few tools which allows us to study the interiors of stars by the interpretation of their non-radial oscillations. In the last years the field went through an unprecedented evolution, thanks to the immense growth in observational data and the vast improvements of asteroseismological techniques. While the nominal Kepler mission already implied a revolution in stellar physics of solar-like stars and red giants, similar achievements were not possible for massive OB stars as most of such targets were avoided in the FoV.

The frequency spectra of the pulsating beta Cep and slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are strongly influenced by the mentioned mixing processes (e.g., Miglio et al. 2008, MNRAS, 386, 1487), which makes them ideal asteroseismic probes. By calculating theoretical pulsation models (based on stellar structure models with different input physics) we can confront the observed and theoretical frequencies and put constraints on the parameters which are either missing from, or ill-constrained in current theories. A handful of available detailed analyses show such a variety in the observed variable behaviour (e.g., Degroote et al. 2010, Nature, 464, 259; Papics et al. 2011, A&A, 528, A123; Degroote et al. 2011, A&A, 536, A82; Papics et al. 2012, A&A, 542, A55), that details in the internal physics of these stars must be different. So far, in-depth seismic modelling resulting in the determination of the overshooting parameter was achieved for only one SPB star from Kepler data (Papics et al. 2014, A&A 570, A8), bringing the total number of OB dwarfs for which this value is available to 16 (Aerts et al. 2014, arXiv:1407.6479). 

Although the amount of observational constraints is growing, the number of in-depth investigations providing precise physical parameters, and their coverage of the instability strips is too low to refine theory. K2 can have a significant contribution to extending this sample, and get us closer to the much-needed precise calibration of stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars. Furthermore, the different K2 Fields pointing towards different stellar populations of the Galaxy will show if/how internal processes and parameters depend on the presence of magnetic field, internal rotation, and stellar properties such as metallicity across the instability strips. Our final goal is to give a quantitative seismic estimate of core overshooting and internal rotational mixing using a sample of B-type stars, and obtain improvements from typically 20% to 1% relative precision in the interior physics laws for such stars. This will propagate to the very first seismic  and thus reliable  calibration of stellar evolution models in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.

We propose a few tens of targets for Fields 6 and 7 of the K2 Mission. All targets are well suited for Long Cadence, because the dominant oscillations are in the order of a day. This also explains why ground-based observations are extremely difficult for these targets."
GO6020,6,John,,Southworth,Keele University,astro.js@keele.ac.uk,"Maxted, Pierre F",Kepler photometry of important eclipsing binaries in K2 fields 6 and 7,"Almost all of astrophysics is underpinned by our understanding of the physics of normal stars. The development of reliable theoretical models of stars, culminating in the 1990s and 2000s, is one of the great achievements of stellar physics. But a plethora of the physical phenomena implemented in modern codes are poorly understood and often reduced to fudge factors, some of which are calibrated on only one object: our Sun. Significant uncertainties surround our understanding of phenomena such as mixing length, convective core overshooting, mass loss, rotation, magnetic fields, and even stellar formation mechanisms.

Eclipsing binary stars (EBs) are our primary source of empirical measurements of stellar properties, and can yield mass and radius measurements to better than 1% (e.g. Southworth et al., 2005, MNRAS, 363, 529). They are thus used to calibrate theoretical models (Pols et al., 1998, MNRAS, 298, 525), provide real-world mass--radius--temperature relations (Torres et al., 2010, A&ARv, 18, 67), and identify parameter space where theoretical models fail (Lopez-Morales, 2007, ApJ, 660, 732). Low-mass EBs show clear deviations from theoretical predictions which currently limit our understanding of extrasolar planets (Southworth, 2009, MNRAS, 394, 272).

Other important uses of EBs are as direct distance indicators (Pietrzynski et al., 2013, Nature, 495, 76), calibrators of asteroseismic scaling relations (Frandsen et al., 2013, A&A, 556, A138), probes of chemical evolution of massive stars (Pavlovski et al., 2009, MNRAS, 400, 791), and tracers of binary evolutionary processes (Maxted et al., 2013, Nature, 498, 463). We now know of circumbinary planets which have been found because they orbit EBs (Doyle et al., 2011, Science, 333, 1602).

The study of an EB is critically dependent on getting a good light curve, from which the radii can be measured to high accuracy. Ground-based studies are hindered by limited photometric precision and the inability to observe during bad weather or daytime, forcing observers to spend sometimes years chasing eclipses of the most interesting and important objects. The remarkable abilities of Kepler bypass these problems, yielding data of much greater quantity and quality than could ever be achieved from the ground. In addition to a K2 light curve, high-resolution spectroscopy is required to determine the masses (through radial velocity measurements) and atmospheric parameters of the stars in an EB. Spectroscopic data can straightforwardly be obtained from ground-based facilities, as continuous monitoring through the orbital period is not required. The K2 data will be reduced using a pipeline currently being developed by our group, and the remaining analysis will be performed with existing tools written or operated by the applicants.

The SuperWASP survey has built up a huge database of billions of photometric measurements of bright stars, which are systematically searched for transiting planets (Pollacco et al., 2006, PASP, 118, 1407). These data are also excellent for the identification of variable stars, particularly EBs. We have searched the SuperWASP database for EBs in K2 fields 6 and 7, finding 15 which are excellent candidates for follow-up K2 observations. We propose 13 targets for long cadence slots, as the deep eclipses mean the system properties can be constrained to high accuracy even using long-cadence observations. Two targets need short-cadence slots due to their small orbital periods, which make their eclipses short. The eclipse durations of these two objects are 73 min and 122 min, so they would be entirely subsumed into 2 and 4 long-cadence datapoints, respectively, leading to poor constraints on the radii of the component stars."
GO6021,6,William,D.,Cochran,The University of Texas at Austin,wdc@astro.as.utexas.edu,"Johnson, Marshall C; Shporer, Avi",Probing the Planetary Population of High-Mass Stars,"Objectives: To date most planet searches have been confined to stars of spectral type F and later, as hotter stars have fewer spectral lines and tend to be rapidly rotating, making radial velocity (RV) observations difficult. By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can help to expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiant stars in this mass range [1], but the actual masses of these subgiants have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus a number of planet candidates which are pending validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement subgiant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets and will be able to probe close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the subgiants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars, which currently number five confirmed planets, too few to allow statistically significant investigations of this population. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2. 

Targets: We plan to request approximately 500 long cadence targets, mostly in Field 7. The sample will consist of A and early F-type dwarfs. We will propose for targets with 8<V<12.5, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: We will process the K2 data and search for planetary transit signals using PyKE. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory; we will leverage our group's experience with similar observations of Kepler prime mission targets. For long-period targets where the K2 observations are insufficient to constrain the transit parameters to the desired precision, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT). Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other techniques. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can even find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (an extension of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to rapidly rotating stars, where the spectral line distortion during transit is spectroscopically resolved) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit. We are currently pursuing a program to validate Kepler prime mission candidates using Doppler tomography [5], and will use the same methodology for K2 candidates.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

GO6023,6,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Hudson, Hugh S",Superflares on RS CVn and BY Dra Stars,"It came as a startling surprise when otherwise-ordinary G-type main sequence stars (including some of the closest known solar twins) were discovered to have flares with energies 10^34 to 10^39 ergs (Schaefer et al. 2000).  These 'superflares' have durations from minutes to days, amplitudes up to 3 mags, and emission from X-ray to radio.  Kepler has made for a revolution in superflares by providing large event numbers on many Sun-like stars (Maehara et al. 2012; Schaefer 2012).  The most popular current model has reconnection of the magnetic fields stretching between the Sun-like star and a nearby planet (Rubenstein & Schaefer 2000; Lanza 2008).  This scenario was explicitly stealing the model for RS CVn superflares.

RS CVn stars are G-type main sequence stars in close orbit (1-14 day orbital periods) around cooler stars, with synchronization speeding up the stellar rotations and hence increasing greatly the magnetic activity of the stars.  BY Dra stars are similar to RS CVns, with a somewhat cooler surface and sometimes apparently single.  RS CVn and BY Dra stars have occasional superflares, with energies up to 10^38 erg, durations from hours to a day, amplitudes up to 1.6 mag, and emission from X-ray to radio.  Models for RS CVn superflares all involve magnetic reconnection with loops stretching between the G-star and the cool star (Simon et al. 1981; Ferreira 1998).  The difference in energy between solar flares and RS CVn superflares is that the loop length could be much longer and the surface field much stronger.  The field configuration, trigger, and detailed microphysics of RS CVn superflares are poorly known (Ferreira 1998).

A small number of RS CVn superflares have been reasonably observed from X-ray to optical to radio.  Nevertheless, there are two glaring gaps in the RS CVn data:  First, the coverage has been much too haphazard and gap-filled, so demographic properties are badly known.  Second, only the largest RS CVn superflares have been detected and reported, leaving it completely unknown as to the existence, frequency, and properties of any low-amplitude events.

We propose to use the K2 mission to monitor RS CVn and BY Dra stars for superflares.  K2 can uniquely solve the two big gaps because the relentless gapless coverage for ~80 days will provide uniform and biasfree flare searches, and because the millimag accuracy allows for the confident detection of superflares with amplitudes over two orders-of-magnitude smaller.  No RS CVn star was targeted in the original Kepler  field or in any K2 fields, other than the 29 RS CVns (with no BY Dra stars) that we proposed for Fields 4 & 5.

We have identified 5 RS CVn stars (in Field 6) and 2 BY Dra stars (in Field 7) brighter than 16th mag that K2fov gives as being on-chip.  For flares found, amplitudes, durations, orbital phases, energy estimates, and light curves would be published, along with demographic results like size-frequency distributions.  The great statistics from K2 will be able to perform tests like measuring the orbital phase dependence of flare frequency so as to distinguish between the magnetic loop and the magnetospheric tail reconnection models.

RELEVANCE:  RS CVn and BY Dra superflares fit into a larger picture of superflares on Sun-like stars, with these other superflares having similar observational properties.  A goal of this K2 proposal is to test how similar are the types of superflares, with this having good relevance for NASA's goal of understanding the biggest solar flares.  Only the K2 mission has the gapless long-term coverage with millimag accuracy as required to spot large and small superflares.

GO6024,6,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,,Short-Duration Flares on Mira Stars,"Mira stars are slowly pulsating red giant stars with periods of order a year, so it came as a startling surprise when they were discovered to have short-duration flares (Schaefer 1991).  These flares were observed with amplitudes 0.4 to 1.4 mag and durations from 3 minutes to 3 hours, and were visible in both the optical and the radio.  Mira flares have been confirmed by Maffei & Tosti (1995), de Laverny et al. (1998), and Stencel et al. (2003), with flare durations lasting up to 6 days.  However, studies by Mais et al. (2004), Wozniak et al. (2004), and Lebzelter (2011) have failed to find any flares on various samples of red giants.  It is currently unclear what subset of Mira stars and what phases show flares, no detailed models have been made, and we have little knowledge of flare demographics.  Models of Mira flares (e.g., Struck et al. 2002) point to magnetic reconnection involving planets orbiting the Mira star.
	
The original Kepler mission did look at 317 M giant stars, but this includes only two classic Mira stars (Banyai et al. 2013).  They do not report any flares, but they only report on Fourier transforms for periods longer than a day, so this study was not sensitive to Mira flares.  Nevertheless, this study provides a proof that Kepler can follow Mira stars with 30-minute time resolution and ~0.1 millimag accuracy.  I have already made successful K2 proposals for 3+30+5+2 Miras in Fields 0, 2, 4, and 5.  (Fields 1 & 3 have no Mira stars.)  I have already reduced the Field 0 light curves, and I find flares at the 0.0005 to 0.0020 mag level.
	
For K2 Fields 6 & 7, I have selected 2 and 49 targets, all confirmed Mira variables.  I selected only those that are always brighter than V=16, to ensure good photometric accuracy, and to avoid biasing against flares near minimum.  All targets are on-chip by K2fov.
	
I propose to have Kepler monitor Mira stars during the K2 mission for Fields 6 & 7, with the 30-minute cadence, with the goal to be to discover flares from a few minutes to days in duration.  (Even with a 3 minute flare, a 0.1 mag amplitude event would be easily detected as a 10 millimag event which should be highly significant.)  The analysis would be to subtract a long-term spline-fit to the light curve, make running box-averages over a wide range of bin-sizes, and seek flares above a 5-sigma significance level (after accounting for the number of trials and bins searched).  This statistical limit will be applicable to fast flares, while flares longer than a day or so will be limited by the accuracy of interpolating the before-and-after light curve.  For flares found, amplitudes, durations, phases, energy estimates, and light curves would be published, along with demographic results like size-frequency distributions.
	
RELEVANCE.    Ground-based light curves are notoriously difficult to find small rare flares, while the Kepler satellite solves this due to having sub-millimag accuracy and a relentless light curve without gaps for many months.  So Kepler is unique at being able to address the many big unknowns regarding Mira flares.  My small K2 program will increase the number of Mira stars monitored by Kepler from 2 (for the original Kepler field) to 93 (with Fields 0-7), and so will make such a big advance that it has the potential for solving many of the questions.  K2 will provide the first accurate and full-coverage light curve for the startling flares on Mira stars, and will give detailed demographic properties, like flare frequency/size/duration as a function of Mira type, period, and phase.

Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system [1-5], colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk [6-7], and studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength which may limit models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration of planetesimals. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies.

Light curves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. These two populations are in stable resonances with Jupiter (Hildas in the 3:2 resonance at 4 AU, Trojans are located at 5 AU in the L4 and L5 Lagrange points of the Sun-Jupiter system) and collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations [8-9]. Results from the WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojan asteroids and ~40% of Hilda asteroids are either extremely elongated objects, or are binaries[10]. Kepler optical light curves are required to confirm these controversial findings. Ground based optical surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability survey. Large amounts of observing time are required, and analysis of lightcurves obtained over a few nights is hampered by aliasing induced by limited photometric sampling over regularly spaced nightly intervals. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform and the correspondence between the Campaign 6 field and the L4 Trojan cloud.

We have identified ~120 objects for study in the Hilda and Trojan asteroid populations to be studied with Kepler in Campaigns 6 & 7 with magnitudes of m_V < 20.  Due to the overlap between the Campaign 6 field and the L4 Trojan cloud, our request for data represents 110 objects Campaign 6 and 10 objects in Campaign 7. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 24 days for our targets. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity to test the results reported by the WISE survey.

GO6026,6,Michael,Thomas,Carini,Western Kentucky University,mike.carini@wku.edu,,Rapid Optical Variability in Infrared and Optically Bright Blazars,"Blazars are extreme examples of the phenomena known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak/absent discrete spectral features leave us with only continuum variability and/or polarization variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. The blazar class of objects is comprised of the BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects and the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ). The difference between a BL Lac and a FSRQ lies primarily in the strength of any emission lines present in the spectrum. In the BL Lac objects, emission lines are nonexistent or are present with equivalent widths < 5 Å, while in the FSRQ emission lines are present with equivalent widths > 5 Å. Blazar spectral energy distributions display a two-bump structure. At low energies there is a peak arising from synchrotron emission in the jet, while at higher energies the peak is believed to be the result of inverse Compton scattering of photons off of relativistic electrons in the jet. The frequency of the synchrotron peak divides blazars into sub-classes: low frequency peaked (LBL), intermediate frequency peaked (IBL), and high frequency peaked (HBL).

Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F6 and F7 field of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of blazars with Kep magnitude < 17 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip (DAbrusco et al. 2012) that are not previously identified blazars. There will be at most 100 sources in the final proposed sample. The Kepler spacecraft demonstrated the ability to produce unprecedented light curves of AGN during the prime Kepler mission (Mushotzky et al. 2011, Carini & Ryle 2012, Edelson et al. 2013, Wherle et al. 2013). Our initial results from K2 F0 and F1 indicate a better than expected performance from K2 (Carini & Williams, 2015).  The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. These observations will allow the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, which is related to the size of the emitting region in the jet via light travel time arguments. They will also allow the determination of the slope of the power spectral density (PSD) on timescales from minutes to several months and allow searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD that indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales. Finally, the expected sampling and quality of this data set will allow a search for quasi-periodic oscillations on the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to extend the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies. 

The K2 Guest Observer-Cycle 2 solicitation calls for acquisition and analysis of new scientific data utilizing K2s high precision/high cadence photometry capabilities. The proposed observations and subsequent science require such observations and are thus relevant to this solicitation.

GO6028,6,Derek,L,Buzasi,Florida Gulf Coast University,dbuzasi@fgcu.edu,"Preston, Heather",Expanding the K2 Legacy,"1. Science Goals and Objectives

The K2 mission has in a short time proven to be a successful successor to Kepler despite limitations in both pointing and observational duration. As with the original mission, pixels from the entire frame are not generally downloaded due to date rate limitations; instead, only predefined postage stamps surrounding the primary targets are made available. As characterization of the mission has improved, postage stamp sizes have shrunk and are now typically 16 x 16 pixels (approximately 1 arc minute square), with some exceptions such as areas surrounding open clusters or particularly bright targets. Even these small postage stamps generally contain several secondary targets in addition to the primary target.

Pipeline data reduction to produce time series from the postage stamps is not provided by the project, and a small number of groups have therefore solved this problem independently (see, e.g. Vanderburg & Johnson 2014, Buzasi et al. 2015), and many of these plan to make their data available to the community. An important distinction of the PIs pipeline is that we can produce light curves for all of the (well-separated) stellar targets in each field of view. We propose to produce light curves for all of the secondary targets in each K2 field of view, perform planet searches in each of those time series, and release the time series to the community.

Note that we are not requesting specific targets, but will take advantage of the fields requested by others to enable us to examine an unbiased (or less-biased) sample. Given the estimated 10,000 primary targets in each pointing, we conservatively estimate that we will produce light curves for 20,000 secondary targets.

2. Methodology

Our pipeline identifies targets in each field which are well-separated enough for accurate photometry and determines appropriate extraction mask sizes and shapes by minimizing noise at multiple user-selectable frequencies. We then generate time series using aperture photometry, and iteratively detrend the time series against CCD position and background level. As presented in Buzasi et al. (2015), we have found that this procedure produces light curves with noise levels less than twice that of the original mission.
 
We will perform planet searches in the resulting time series using both matched-filter approaches and a citizen science method inspired by the Planet Hunters program (http://www.planethunters.org). In the latter case, a year-long honors program course taught by the PI at Florida Gulf Coast University will visually examine light curves generated by the pipeline, taking advantage of human pattern recognition skills to identify periodic transit-like events. Students will follow up with more detailed analysis to produce planet candidate lists. We anticipate that the citizen science approach will find most of the hot Jupiters in the sample, while the matched-filter approach will be more suited to smaller candidates. Candidate lists and light curves will be publicly released to enable other researchers to verify our findings and perform their own searches, as well as to perform other science such as asteroseismology. We will also work with a local planetarium to produce public outreach products.

3. Relevance

While the K2 mission is a general-user facility and lacks primary science objectives, clearly exoplanet science continues to generate the most excitement connected with the missions, and we will focus our attention on that aspect. However, the light curves we will produce and release will include a wide variety of different kinds of objects, including potentially source types we have not yet seen with either Kepler or K2, and thus will be of the broadest scientific interest and relevance to NASA science objectives. Our educational and public outreach components will further contribute to the significance of the proposed project to NASA."
GO6029,6,Brian,K,Jackson,Boise State University,bjackson@dtm.ciw.edu,"Adams, Elisabeth Rose; Endl, Michael",Looking for Very Short Period Planets with the K2 Mission,"Science Goals and Objectives  From wispy gas giants on the verge of disruption to tiny rocky bodies already falling apart, short period exoplanets pose a severe challenge to theories of planet formation and evolution, but they dominate observational constraints on planetary composition, internal structure, meteorology, and more. For instance, the only rocky exoplanets for which mass estimates can be made (except for the few fortuitous systems that exhibit transit-timing variations) are those in very short period orbits  Kepler-10 b and, recently, Kepler-78 b are two famous examples. Moreover, understanding the origins of very short period planets may elucidate key processes in formation and evolution. Gas disk migration may have brought the objects in from where they formed but would require disks extending to nearly the stellar surfaces, contrary to observations and theoretical expectations that stellar magnetospheres truncate gas disks much farther out. We propose to collect photometric observations of stars that may host very short period planets (with periods d 1 day) using the K2 mission. We will convert the raw K2 images into light curves and search for transits. We will follow up putative transit candidates with spectral and radial velocity observations to continue the already fruitful and exciting search for very short period planets.

Targets  Our proposal will include d 1,000 main-sequence F-K stars, putting our proposal in the small category. We will select objects suitable for spectral observation and possible radial velocity (RV) follow-up and use the online tool provided by K2 to check that all targets fall on K2 silicon (code 2). We request that our targets be observed even if this proposal is not selected for funding.

Methodology  For Task 1, we will generate photometric time series from the raw K2 images, and the Kepler PyKE python package provides the necessary capabilities, based on Vanderburg & Johnson (2014). For Task 2, we will detrend light curves and apply an automated search algorithm (EEBLS  Kovacs et al., 2002) to find transits. We will also perform (to the extent possible) photometric and pixel-level analyses to vet candidate signals. For Task 3, for vetted candidates, we will characterize host stars and collect RV observations using low-precision spectra to rule out binaries and blend scenarios. For available targets, we will collect and analyze precise RVs from the HRS spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory to confirm candidates as planets and estimate their masses. For targets inaccessible from McDonald, we will propose for follow-up observations at a suitable facility, Keck, for example.

Relevance  This proposal will leverage the unique capabilities of the K2 mission to look for an unusual and astrophysically compelling class of planet.

The first of our two objectives is to measure variations in the occurrence rate of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood. We already see differences between the populations of planets orbiting nearby stars and stars in the prime Kepler Field.  For example, hot Jupiters are 2.5 times less abundant in the Kepler Field (Howard et al. 2012).  We have to wonder if the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone (Petigura et al. 2013) is similarly reduced relative to nearby stars. With this proposal we will measure the occurrence of detectable, short-period super-Earths and Neptune-size planets (~2-3 Earth-radii). Our second goal is to discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  This Cycle 2 proposal for the C6 and C7 fields is part of our larger effort covering all K2 fields and is a merger of the Cycle 1 programs by A. Howard/E. Petigura and J. Winn/R. Sanchis-Ojeda.

We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts. request approximately 5000 stars in a magnitude-limited sample with Kp < 13 and approximately 3000 stars with Kp > 13 but excellent planet detectability (mostly late G and K dwarfs).  This Cycle 2 request for Campaigns 6 and 7 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in C0 (R. Sanchis-Ojeda - 3641/7758 selected), C1 (R. Sanchis-Ojeda - 3755/7000 selected), C2 (E. Petigura - 4115/5311 selected), C3 (E. Petigura; 3859/5875 selected), C4 (A. Howard - 5195 proposed; J. Winn - 16,700 proposed), C5 (A. Howard - 4471 proposed; J. Winn - 15,600 proposed) constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.

We are searching for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013). We will compute the occurrence rates of small, close-in planets using injection-and-recovery tests to account for the sensitivity of TERRA and will report the field-to-field variability and overall rates of planet occurrence. Assuming a precision of 80 ppm over 6.5 hours, a 2 Earth-radii planet with P = 20-day will be detectable at SNR = 8 during a single 75-day K2 campaign.  Based on the prime mission occurrence statistics, we expect to find 3.1 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with P < 20 days per 1,000 stars observed. A sample of 5,000 stars is expected to yield ~15 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with orbital periods less than 20 days, providing an occurrence measurement with 25% fractional uncertainty. With 5,000 stars, we will be sensitive to factor-of-two variations in the occurrence rate of 2-3 Earth-radii planets at 4-sigma significance.

In addition, we will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES and other facilities. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultrashort-period Earths. Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission.

This proposal directly addresses two objectives from the prime Kepler mission: measuring planet occurrence rates and characterizing small planets with Doppler mass measurements."

Expanding the Temporal Baseline for
Extragalactic Systems","We propose to monitor ~200 / 100 bright galaxies within the K2-C6 & K2-C7 fields of view  extending the Kepler Galaxy Legacy Survey, which originated during the prime mission and also collected data during the early campaigns of the K2 mission. This survey is sensitive to both quasi-continuous variability, originating in low-level flickering produced by embedded active galactic nuclei, and random episodic events, particularly supernovae. Our primary objectives are: (a) to quantify the presence of optical photometric variability within galactic systems using Keplers unique blend of high precision and continuous monitoring, (b) define the existence and amplitude of AGN signals in galaxy cores, (c) provide a direct measure of supernovae rates across a range of galaxy types, and, (d) quantify the initial brightening of supernova as the explosion rises to peak luminosity. The proposed observations include a larger range of morphological types than in the prime mission and also benefits from a better informed ancillary dataset for these galaxies, especially redshifts. In this cycle we will focus on optically blue galaxies with modest star formation rates, to maximize the potential signal from Type II supernova. Only systems with known redshifts are included, to provide luminosity information for detected supernova and to scale variability according to stellar mass. Continued monitoring of galactic systems with K2, while limited in long-term temporal coverage compared to the prime mission, will continue to advance our overall understanding of a variety of physical phenomenon, expanding the fundamental temporal baseline for extragalactic investigations with Kepler."

ramifications for our understanding of how other galaxies form and evolve. Success will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution. This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the solar
neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that
asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.

RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.

AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (~7000-9000 per campaign) to probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys structure and evolution from its stellar populations.

METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys
targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use our seismic inferred stellar properties to stress-test state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia,
TRILEGAL)."
GO6033,6,Patrick,,Gaulme,New Mexico State University,gaulme@nmsu.edu,"Jackiewicz, Jason",Solar-like Oscillations in Eclipsing-Binary Systems,"We propose to use K2 unique capability to detect solar-like oscillations of main-sequence and red-giant stars that belong to well-known eclipsing binaries. This proposal follows those submitted for K2 fields 0, 1, and 2. In Field O (GO0073), we were awarded one short-cadence and three long-cadence targets. In Fields 1 and 3 (GO1034 & GO3064), our two submitted targets were selected for short-cadence observations (no submitted targets in Field 2). Decisions regarding Fields 4 and 5 are pending. This document is an overview of the proposal that will be submitted by February 27.

Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. As illustrated by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, asteroseismology is an efficient method to measure masses, radii, and ages of large numbers of stars, which is of prime importance to test stellar evolution. However, a crucial test of both asteroseismic masses and radii of a large sample of stars with independent measurements of those quantities has not yet been carried out. Eclipsing binary systems (EBs) potentially permit such an exercise by allowing for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, provided that spectral lines are detectable for both components. EBs are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough (e.g. Gaulme et al. 2014). So far, all the published stars known to both display solar-like oscillations and belong to EBs are red-giants (RGs), and all have been detected by the Kepler mission. The first detection was the 408-day period system KIC 8410637 (Hekker et al. 2010, Frandsen et al. 2013). Since then, Gaulme et al. (2013 & 2014) reported a list of 18 bona fide new RG eclipsing-binary candidates, of which 14 displayed oscillations. More recently, Beck et al. (2014) reported the discovery of 18 new heartbeat stars, where each system has a RG component with oscillations, and three are also EBs. Provided that oscillations are detected, observing known EBs with K2 is a unique opportunity to extend the sample of systems to test asteroseismology.

The purpose of this GO proposal is to observe a small set of eclipsing binaries that are already well characterized in terms of physical parameters (orbits, masses, radii). Doing so present two main advantages. Firstly, observing well-known systems helps predicting the likelihood of detecting solar-like oscillations. Secondly, the objective is to reduce the burden of ground-based follow-up, which is very time-consuming when radial-velocities need to be measured. The target list is obtained by pre-selecting systems from the General Catalog of Variable Stars (GCVS), then by checking the available literature.  A set of eight targets has been identified in K2s fields 6 and 7. 

Funding will be requested to pay a graduate student for a 1-year and two trips to Europe, where most of the asteroseismic conferences/workshops are held.

The Hot Jupiter planet, Qatar 2b, has an orbital period of 1.3371182 days and a corresponding semi major axis to stellar radius ratio of 6.489. With such a short period and at a semi major axis at less than 3 times the fluid Roche limit of it's host star, Qatar-2 is an excellent candidate for short cadence photometry using K2 in order to probe the previously observed stellar activity of the host star (Mancini et al. 2014, MNRAS, 443, 3) and in order to search for transit timing variations and photometric variation in ellipsoidal variations. As a result we request short cadence observations of Qatar 2 during Campaign 6 of the K2 mission.

Each of the three goals listed for this proposal would benefit from the high precision photometry K2 will provide. Similarly bright K0 targets (Kp 13-13.1) have produced 6 hr precision levels of ~60-65 ppm using techniques which account for the nonuniform pixel response function of the Kepler detectors by correlating flux measurements with the spacecraft's pointing and removing the dependence (Vanderburg and Johnson 2014, PASP, 126, 944). Stellar spot variations have been several factors larger than these values and have been indicative of high stellar activity beneath the planet's transit chord. Greater stellar activity and magnetic activity of the host star in tandem with Qatar 2b's relatively high density and cooler expected planetary equilibrium temperatures as compared to inflated Hot Jupiters may help bound conditions for inflation of close in gas giants. Observations using K2 would help explore this stellar activity and its influence on system and bulk parameters.

Estimates for combined ellipsoidal variations in both the star and planet are calculated to be at least 40 ppm using the lowest values for albedo (~0.1) to over 200 ppm for larger values (~0.5) also predicted in literature. This range of values is below the limit of ground based observations but should exceed the precision levels expected from K2  this additional signal to noise constitutes the significant added value that K2 observations would provide over ground based data. The high precision photometry of K2 would enable characterization of the photosphere of Qatar 2b in addition to the stellar photosphere and could enable analysis of potential asphericity driven signatures (Saxena et al. 2015, MNRAS, 446, 4) that may lurk within the lightcurve of Qatar 2. Such variations would help supplement previous characterization of the atmosphere and bulk properties of Qatar 2b. The high cadence observations of this short period planet will provide very precise measurement of transit mid-times and subsequently would allow for high quality TTV analysis. While increased stellar activity can often confound TTV study, the higher photometric precision of K2 versus ground based observations would compensate for the lower 30-minute cadence and allow stronger TTV constraints  again demonstrating the additional value such a proposal would have over ground based studies.

The team that would work on the data analysis proposed for Qatar 2b is highly qualified to work on this project. Joshua Pepper (Pepper et al. 2013, ApJ, 773, 1), Carolina von Essen (von Essen et al. 2014, A&A, 561, 48) and Joseph E. Rodriguez have substantial expertise in extracting system and bulk parameters from data analysis of transiting exoplanets. Michael Summers and Prabal Saxena have shown the capability of extracting asphericity signals and derived bulk parameters from interpretation of transit light curves. Finally, Dr. von Essen and other members of the team have access to meter class telescopes that may be able to provide corroborating follow up observations of Qatar 2b."

Here we propose to use the K2 observatory to monitor a handful of systems know to host close-in gas giant planets in search of planetary signals at visible wavelengths, specifically phase variations.  The shape and amplitude of planetary phase variations at visible wavelengths place important constraints on the planetary albedo, global circulation patterns, and global energy budgets, especially when combined with similar observations at longer wavelengths from observatories such as the Spitzer Space Telescope.  Phase-curve observations of Kepler-7b from the original Kepler mission revealed the presence of an inhomogenous cloud layer.  We hope to add to the current population of exoplanets with visible wavelength phase-curve observations by selecting the most viable targets in the K2 field of view for Campaigns 6 and 7.  By expanding the catalog of exoplanet visible wavelength phase-curve observations we will help to further refine atmospheric theories for hot Jupiters.

Methodology:  Four known exoplanet hosts that are sufficiently bright for phase-curve studies (V < 14) will fall upon the active silicon of the K2 detectors during Campaigns 6 and 7.    The planets in these four systems (WASP-55b, Qatar-2b WASP-67b, and HD179949b) are all Jupiter-sized planets, but span a wide range in effective temperature (1000-1900 K) and density (0.2-2.2 g/cc).  Effective temperature and planetary density, and hence gravity, are the two of the strongest drivers of both cloud formation and atmospheric circulation processes.  Two of the targets (WASP-67b and HD179949b) have been observed with Spitzer, which will allow us to disentangle the competing effects of thermal emission and scattering in the Kepler bandpass.  In particular HD179949b, a close analog to Kepler-7b, has existing 8 micron phase-curve observations.  We will use our well-developed Kepler pipeline to process the data to achieve the level of precision necessary to robustly detect any phase variations/secondary eclipses if present.  We will further develop three-dimensional atmospheric models for these planets to aid in the interpretation of the K2 data for the identified planets.  

Relevance:  The observations proposed here are highly relevant to the scope of the K2 Guest Observer program.  Specifically, the proposed observations make use of K2s unique visible wavelength high-precision photometric capabilities.  Phase-curve observations require long-duration, ideally uninterrupted, stares that only a facility such as K2 can provide at visible wavelengths, which provide important probes of planetary albedo and global circulation patterns."
GO6037,6,Philip,Steven,Muirhead,Boston University,philipm@bu.edu,"West, Andrew A; Skinner, Julie N; Cushing, Michael C; Schneider, Adam",Activity and Planets at the Bottom of the Main-Sequence,"We propose to observe a carefully selected sample of ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs) with K2 during Campaigns 6 and 7.  UCDs occupy the transition from main-sequence stars to brown dwarfs (late-M and later) and are essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the lowest mass objects in the Universe.  Historically, photometric monitoring of UCDs for transiting planets and rotational spot modulation has been hampered by their intrinsic faintness and the expected short duration of transit events.  The K2 spacecraft provides an excellent opportunity to study these objects in more detail, thanks to the large aperture and near-continuous 80-day photometric coverage of each K2 field.

Searching for Transiting Planets Orbiting UCDs: The discovery of a transiting-planet orbiting a UCD would having significant implications for the field of exoplanets.  UCDs are small, all roughly the diameter of Jupiter, which implies deep fractional transit signatures.  UCDs are also relatively bright in the infrared.  A planet that transits a UCD, whether gaseous or rocky, would be an ideal target for near-infrared transit transmission spectroscopy, as has been successfully performed on super Earths orbiting mid-M dwarf stars with the Hubble Space Telescope.  Future transit transmission observations with NASAs James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets, but only for those planets that transit ultra-cool dwarfs.  The transits from rocky planets orbiting mid-M dwarf stars and earlier are simply not deep enough to search for biosignatures over the expected lifetime of JWST.  Recent studies of short-period planet occurrence around early and mid M dwarfs show that lower mass stars have significantly more rocky short-period planets than Sun-like stars. Extrapolating to ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect a large fraction, if not all UCDs to harbor rocky planets with transit probabilities of ~10%.

Spot morphology at the M/L transition: Studies indicate that over 90% of UCDs show evidence of surface activity in the form of H± emission; however, the nature of the activity is not fully understood.  Unlike sun-like stars, UCDs have fully convective interiors and are expected to have magnetic field morphologies markedly different from the Sun.  With precise photometric monitoring of UCDs with K2 we will measure the morphology of spots on the surfaces of UCDs via light curve inversion.  We will also search for flare events and correlate those flare events to specific spots structures.

Surface activity in UCDs is related to stellar wind and ultraviolet emission from their chromospheres, both of which affect the photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets.  Understanding the nature of surface activity on UCDs is therefore critical for interpreting transit-transmission spectroscopy, as well as inferring the habitability of any detected planets.  K2 provides a unique opportunity to study ultra-cool dwarfs in a way never before realized."

Kepler monitored 15 of these systems with results currently published for 8. The detailed coverage enabled unique studies of quiescent orbital and sporadic variability as well as the changes in the disk and stream impact area during short and long dwarf nova outbursts. We propose to monitor a set of CVs in the K2 fields of Campaigns 6 and 7. The Cycle 2 fields represent the extremes of stellar densities with the directions toward the pole and Galactic center. We have matched the K2 fields with several CV databases and expect a total of about 12 targets will be requested in this cycle. These data will extend the range of CV types studied with Kepler's unprecedented continuous, fast-candence observations."

sequence dwarfs and sub-giants, for asteroseismic observations in K2 Fields 6 and 7. These stars are predicted to show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes. Short cadence data are therefore a pre-requisite for detecting the oscillations. Our list comprises stars that will be prime targets for one of the main goals of K2, the detection of exoplanets around bright solar-type stars, for which precise RV follow-up will be possible. We seek to take advantage of the opportunity to have Kepler observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed in the nominal Mission. Because the targets are brighter, much more accurate and detailed prior constraints (e.g., from parallaxes, detailed spectroscopy, interferometry, etc.) will be available on these stars than was usually the case for asteroseismic targets in the original field. It will therefore be possible to bring the full potential of asteroseismology to bear to test the physics of stellar interiors. It will also be possible to go beyond studying stellar structure, to put constraints on the evolution of the solar neighbourhood. These solar-type targets in Field 6 and 7, along with the targets from previous and future fields, will allow us to constrain the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars in a manner that has not been possible before. Note that asteroseismic data can constrain stellar ages much better than any other method. By providing asteroseismic ages of stars with detectable surface rotation periods we will also provide additional calibrators for gyrochonology. And of course, asteroseismology will allow us to better characterize targets that have detected exoplanets, including any new detections made by K2 and also already-known hosts that are on our list."

They provide fundamental stellar parameters (masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities) for objects across the H-R diagram. The K2 mission will probe fields along the ecliptic, thus allowing us to study inherently different stellar populations and their distributions as a function of galactic latitude. Campaigns 6 and 7 focus on the most diverse populations, namely in the direction of the north galactic cap and the galactic center, including NGC 6717, a globular cluster in Sagittarius. Because stars in clusters are coeval, share a common evolutionary path and feature the same chemical abundances, eclipsing binaries found in clusters serve as distance calibrators and stellar population gauges. We collected all known eclipsing binary stars in fields 6 and 7 from available online catalogs (via Simbad and VizieR services), and performed a thorough search for binaries in the proprietary Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) and SuperWASP survey data to assemble a list of proposed targets for this solicitation. The reduction and analysis will be done by experienced members of the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Working Group."
GO6041,6,Ming,,Zhao,Penn State University,mingzhao@psu.edu,"Wright, Jason T; Beatty, Thomas G; Bastien, Fabienne Anne; Curtis, Jason Lee",K2 monitoring of known transiting planet phase curves and bright planet hosts,"We propose K2 monitoring of known, nearby transiting planet phase curves and characterization of known planet hosts in the Campaign 6 & 7 fields. Nearby known planets are all orbiting bright stars (V<13) and have Radial Velocity (RV) measurements.  Continuous K2 monitoring of these rare but important targets will provide invaluable data for detailed high precision characterization of both the planets and their host stars. Previous K2 campaigns, unfortunately, have missed most, if not all, of these nearby bright and known planetary systems (e.g., WASP-17, WASP-47, WASP-75, GJ 876, etc., to name a few).  We therefore propose and urge Campaigns 6 & 7 to include these systems.

In particular, Campaigns 6 & 7 will have better pointing than previous ones, and Campaign 6 will cover a high galactic latitude, providing the highest available photometry quality in K2. Our main science goals are: 1. to measure the optical phase curves and albedos of available known transiting hot Jupiters, study their atmospheric dynamics in the case where infra-red phase curves are (or will be) available, and compare with other hot Jupiters as an ensemble; 2. to measure the optical secondary eclipses of these hot Jupiters and constrain their orbital eccentricity with existing RV data to study their dynamical history; 3. to look for possible transits of known RV planets in these two fields; and 4. to characterize the stellar properties (rotation, activity) of known planet hosts and long-term RV targets to better understand the stars, their planets, and aid the search of additional planets in these systems. 

We propose ~10 known planetary systems and long-term California Planet Search (CPS) RV targets in Campaigns 6 & 7, including four transiting planets. We require short cadence data for the known transiting planets in order to constrain the ingress and egress timing of their transits and eclipses to precisely measure their eccentricity. We only need long cadence data for the rest of the RV systems. We will implement the detrending and calibration methodology developed by Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) and combine it with our own algorithms to extract the raw K2 light curves. Our transiting planet host stars are in the magnitude range of 11 to 13 mag in the visible, falling in the sweet spot of the demonstrated K2 precision of 30 - 40 ppm per 6-hour integration (Vanderburg & Johnson 2014),  sufficient to measure the optical phase curves and secondary eclipses of these best hot Jupiters with high significance when combining the 75-day data together. 

Our science goals are directly related to exoplanet detection, characterization and stellar astrophysics, all of which are the main areas of the K2 GO program and NASAs exoplanet exploration program. These observations cannot be replicated from the ground due to the requirement of continuous monitoring and very high precision for optical phase curves. Particularly, the optical phase curves will be rare and valuable datasets for exoplanet characterization before the era of TESS."
GO6043,6,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,"Jao, Wei-Chun","A search for exoplanets and close stellar/substellar companions in the local
halo population for K2 campaigns 6-7","We propose to expand the scope of the original Kepler mission by conducting a systematic search for exoplanets orbiting the very old stars of the Galactic halo, a population of stars that was not targeted to any significant degree in the original Kepler mission. Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is know about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. However, our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed in campaigns 6-7 of the Kepler K2 mission identifies 2,709 high-velocity subdwarfs that are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, to identify and characterize the first generation of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will be complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."
GO6045,6,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",A Search for Transiting Objects Orbiting White Dwarf Stars,"Science Goals and Objectives: Given their small size, white dwarf stars present a very intriguing sample to monitor for transiting objects.  Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013).  The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations.  The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]).  Given the extreme difficulty of measuring atmospheric properties of Earth-sized planets around solar-like stars, our first biomarker characterization of an Earth-sized planetary atmosphere, may come from an object transiting a white dwarf star.  Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015).  I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours.  Even if no planets are detected for a significant sample of white dwarfs, an interesting constraint can be put on the population of such planets.

Estimate of the Number of Targets:  Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). 

Methodology:  Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total.  The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits.  Additionally, the first planets detected were around a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992), so it may also be possible for white dwarfs to host planets.  Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign.  Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence.  Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground.  While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation.  However, a follow-up campaign on known targets is quite straightforward.  At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope.  However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation:  A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates.  This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO6046,6,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",Monitoring Targets Within 100 Light Years,"Science Goals and Objectives: Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 light years provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres.  A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets.  It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come.  I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 light years or 30.7 pc.  A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons.  This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes.  This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques.  Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars.  While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges.  A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns).  This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars).  In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored.  The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets.

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability.  An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003).  One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium.  This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint.  Long cadence observations would be appropriate. 

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found.  These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation.  This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO6047,6,Mike,D,Reed,Missouri State University,mikereed@missouristate.edu,"Baran, Andrzej S; Telting, John; Jeffery, Christopher Simon; Ostensen, Roy H.",K2 Observations of Pulsating Subdwarf B Stars in Fields 6 and 7.,"We propose to explore core structure of horizontal branch stars by applying asteroseismological tools to Kepler data of extreme horizontal branch (spectral class subdwarf B) stars. Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars which happen to pulsate, and that allows us to probe their structure. From Kepler's main mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes to constrain structure models from period spacings and frequency multiplets. 
        Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age- some stars show substantial mode trapping while in others it is almost completely absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of differnet evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models.
        Frequency multiplets also tell us rotation periods and orientation of the pulsation axis. From this information we have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary period down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components.
        We made significant progress from the original Kepler mission. However, to fully exploit those advances, we need to complete the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). It would also be a huge benefit to have more examples of pulsators in binaries, as that allows us to more fully explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection.
        To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of a selection of likely sdB pulsators and long-cadence (LC) observations of remaining sdB stars. The SC data can fully explore pulsations and short-period (1 day) binaries and while the LC data can detect some pulsations while still exploring binary sdB stars, especially the longer-period ones.
        Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.
        We will be proposing for about five stars for Campaign 6 and eight for Campaign 7. While none of these are known to pulsate, we only apply for the most promising targets, both in terms of pulsations and interesting binary properties.
        We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include graduate and undergraduate students as signficant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training."

The small size of a white dwarf (WD) star (approximately 1 Earth radii) implies that any sub-stellar or gas giant companion at suitable orbital inclination will completely eclipse it, while terrestrial bodies smaller than the Moon, including asteroids, will still produce transits that are detectable in high signal/noise light-curves.

Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approximately 25% at circa 1Gyr, Zuckerman et al. 2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.

The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically signicant (500 to 1000) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a signicant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).

A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al. (2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al. (2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD? 

This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery. 

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm (5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 11 and 1 (campaigns 6 and 7 respectively) spectroscopically identified WDs brighter than Kepler Magnitude of approximately 19.0 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues to be observed at LC by Kepler 2 in Fields 6 and 7."

Scientific Justification
In the last few years, M dwarfs have been the objects of desire regarding the search of exoplanets resembling as much as possible our own Earth. The reasons behind it are the more favorable planet-star mass ratio to detect the gravitational pull via Doppler shifts and the increase in transit probability, due to planets being closer to the small host M dwarf. This increase in transit probability is emphasized for close-in planets with orbital periods of only a few hours and shorter semi major axis. Nowadays, there are six exoplanets with periods shorter than half a day and less than 1.5 Earth radii (Sanchís-Ojeda et al. 2013, ApJ, 775, 54; Batalha et al. 2011, ApJ, 729, 27; Charpinet et al. 2011, Nature, 480, 496), two of which orbit M dwarfs: KOI-1843b (Ofir and Dreizler 2013, A&A, 555, A58) and Kepler-42c (Muirhead et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 144). The physical nature of these newly discovered objects is a matter of debate and finding more objects to test the class and its role in the planet formation scenarios is crucial, and the object of this proposal.

The traditional sampling long cadences of exoplanets searches are inadequate and a handicap for the detection of short period signals, as the one we aim here. Therefore, we request 1 minute cadence observations of about a dozen targets, selected to be the brightest in the field from the CARMENES spectrograph input catalog (CARMENCITA; Caballero et al. 2013, Protostars and Planets VI, Heidelberg) and from the Exoplanets database.

The short cadence observations required have a twofold objective as they naturally combine synergies with the search for pulsations around M dwarfs. The theoretical instability strip of M dwarfs has been predicted (Rodríguez-López et al. 2014, MNRAS, 438, 2371) for M dwarfs in the main sequence with Teff [3300, 4300]K and logg [4.5, 5.1], where the proposed targets will be chosen, to show periods in the 20 minutes to 3 hours range. Amplitudes are unknown but expected to be in the ppm regime. Therefore, short cadence observations with a large baseline are essential to be able to detect the shortest periods and low amplitudes. The discovery of the first pulsating M dwarf would be a breakthrough, allowing the independent precise determination of critical parameters of the star, such as its age, and of the possible planets.

Should null results in planets discovery or pulsations be obtained, the data would still produce very useful science to be exploited within CARMENES consortium through the characterization of photometric variability due to flares and magnetic activity modulated by stellar rotation.

Methodology
Light curves will be extracted from the target pixel files, corrected from outliers and smoothed with appropriate splines, and a Fourier Transform analysis will be done to search for any periodicities in the data (Rodríguez-López et al. 2015, MNRAS, 446, 2613). The data will be promptly published: in case of a planet discovery, a derivation of the parameters of the system, dynamical studies and ground-based follow-up is planned; in the case of discovery of pulsations, a publication in a high-impact review journal is foreseen, as it will be the first pulsating of the class. Theoretical models and tools are ready to do a complete asteroseismic analysis of the frequencies of oscillation and derive fundamental parameters of the star.

This proposal perfectly addresses some of the K2 Science Motivations: 1/ the characterization of the internal structure and fundamental properties of stars using the tools of asteroseismology and 2/ goes a step further in providing a yield of small planets around bright and small stars to facilitate precise follow-up; even if some of the stars are faint, CARMENES still will be capable of doing the follow-up, resulting in a fruitful alliance between K2 mission and CARMENES."
GO6054,6,Niall,R,Deacon,Max Planck Institute for Astronomy,nialldeacon@hotmail.com,"Mann, Andrew Withycombe; Kraus, Adam L",The effect of wide binaries on planet occurrence - K2 Campaign 6,"We plan to observe a sample of wide binaries spread across the K2 fields to constrain the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence and to provide benchmark systems for gyrochronology.

Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence. Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013).  In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star. Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity. Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars. 

Science Goal 2: Provide benchmark gyrochronology systems. Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components. By including wide binary components as Kepler targets, we will produce a valuable legacy product to test and recalibrate gyrochronology relations allowing the ages of field stars to be better constrained.

Target Selection. We will use the proper motion catalogue produced by Kraus et al. (2014) based on the methods of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007) including proper motions, estimated spectral types and distance moduli from SED fitting. We will select objects with significant (>5sigma) proper motions above 30mas/yr. From these we will select pairs of widely separated objects with common proper motion and distance.  To remove contamination due to coincident pairings of unrelated field stars, we will plot a histogram similar to the one we constructed for fields 4 & 5 of pair separations. From this we will select pairs which lie in the region dominated by true physical pairs. We will likely only select candidates in field 6 as our preliminary analysis suggests that field 7's low latitude means that the coincident pairing rate is too high to select any true common proper motion binaries."
GO6055,6,Barry,,Smalley,Keele University,b.smalley@keele.ac.uk,"Holdsworth, Daniel L; Ripepi, Vincenzo; Murphy, Simon James; Catanzaro, Gianni","The Am stars: peculiarities, pulsations and planets","The metallic-line (Am) stars are a sub-class of A-type stars which exhibit strong lines of transition elements and weakening of Ca and Sc lines compared to the strength of the Balmer lines. The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars needs to be rotating more slowly than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 210 days.

The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. Many, but not all, Am stars therefore do pulsate, generally with lower amplitude than normal abundance delta Scuti stars. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars.

Currently there are only two A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33 and Kepler-13A). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars.

Using Kepler and K2, we have begun a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to:
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion,
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binary within the Am stars,
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars.

Only 11 Am stars were observed during the Kepler mission. So far with K2 a further 29 stars have been observed during K2 Campaigns 0 to 3. For this proposal we have 7 targets in Campaign 6 and 17 targets in Campaign 7 for observation in Long Cadence mode. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to well over of 50.
 
The proposal team are experienced in the reduction of Kepler data using PyKE tools and in the analysis of time-varying photometry. We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary.

The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."
GO6057,6,Arthur,,Vigan,Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille,arthur.vigan@lam.fr,"Barros, Susana CC; Deleuil, Magali; Moutou, Claire; Santerne, Alexandre; Demangeon, Olivier",Looking for young planetary systems with K2 and VLT/SPHERE,"We propose to join the forces of K2 from space and SPHERE at the VLT to detect planetary systems around 8 young (25-600 Myr), nearby (3-60 pc) stars, which are part of our 200-nights direct imaging survey that will be conducted with SPHERE over the next 5 years. 

Looking for planetary systems around young stars with Kepler is a compelling approach to provide constraints on the migration mechanisms and their timescales (Lloyd et al. 2013, arXiv, 1309.1520). In particular, for hot Jupiters, it would allow discriminating between migration during formation within the protoplanetary disk (e.g. Alibert et al. 2004, A&A, 417, 25) and migration through tidal interactions (e.g. Rasio & Ford 1996, Science, 274, 954) that occur on much longer timescales (>500 Myr). For our targets, K2 will provide unprecedented access to the innermost orbital regions around these stars, allowing the identification of small planet candidates within 0.3 AU. The direct imaging follow-up at high-contrast and high-angular resolution with VLT/SPHERE will not only decrease the probability of astrophysical false-positives by background objects to extremely low levels, but it will also complete the picture of these systems in the 5-50 AU range thanks to its unique sensitivity to young giant planets. In addition, some of our targets are also part of a long-term, high-precision radial velocity monitoring with HARPS at the ESO 3.6 m telescope in La Silla, which will allow bridging the gap between the K2 and SPHERE observations.

Any joint detection of a planetary system with K2 and SPHERE would be a major discovery and constitute a ""Rosetta stone"" system for the study and understanding of migration processes and interactions in planetary systems. This is a central question for systems with giant planets at wide orbital separation, for which the far out location could be the result of migration through gravitational interactions with other planets in the system.

Finally, the youngest of our stars can present a significant variability and spots that can challenge the detection of transit signals. To improve our sensitivity to small planets, we propose to observe our targets younged than 250 Myr in short-cadence, which will enable a better filtering of the activity during the processing of the data. In addition, this will allow using asteroseismology to determine the stellar properties down to a few percent, providing an even better understanding of these interesting young stars.

In summary, we want to look for young planetary systems using two powerful exoplanet-hunting instruments, K2 and VLT/SPHERE. We propose to observe 8 stars with ages <600~Myr that will fall into the K2 Fields #6 and #7. All but one have late spectral types and a Kepler magnitude Kp<10. We propose to obtain short-cadence data for 5 of them to use asteroseismology to constraint the physical properties of these young star and to increase our sensitivity to small planets."

ranging from 0.05 to 10 days, and must have evolved through the common-envelope-ejection (CEE) process. The closest systems are quite easy to study from the ground, but Kepler observations have opened the door for precise studies of the population of systems with periods between
0.5 and and 10 days.

Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission. The excellent Kepler light curves show photometric signals from Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal deformations and mutual irradiation effects. Long-cadence K2 observations presents us with an unique opportunity to accumulate a larger sample of post-common envelope sdB binaries that can shed light on the statistics of the CEE process, and thereby constrain the long sought after efficiency parameters that govern the common envelope stage of evolution. In the process we hope to find new particularly interesting binary systems, such as the eclipsing cases and those with extraordinary masses that could be progenitors of type-Ia supernovae."

Thanks to its fast photometric cadence, continuous monitoring and high photometric accuracy, Kepler has provided unprecedented insights into various types of compact binaries, and holds an enormous potential for other astrophysical domains on top of planet hunting. Some of the most notable studies have revealed i) the mass ratio and precise orbital parameters through Doppler beaming and Romer delays for compact binaries (Bloemen et al. 2011, MNRAS,410, 178, Bloemen et al. 2012, MNRAS, 422, 2600), ii) the discovery of the rms-flux relation in the aperiodic flickering of accreting white dwarfs (WD, Scaringi et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 2854) iii) stringent tests to the disk instability model through the precise characterization of dwarf nova (DN) outburst cycles and (Cannizzo et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 117) iv) the application of the fluctuating accretion disk model employed on aperiodic variability of X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei to accreting white dwarfs (Scaringi 2014, MNRAS, 438, 1233).

All targets have been selected from the Ritter & Kolb cataloge (A&A, 404, 301). We will probe for all their broad-band variability properties. Together with similar targets observed during the previous K2 campaigns, this will form the most comprehensive study of optical aperiodic variability in accreting compact objects. The results will be compared to the X-ray variability observed in X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei to test the current accretion disk models.

Here a brief description of each one:

V1082 Sgr, Field 7: Nova-like cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 20.8 hours. This will be the longest period nova-like observed with Kepler.

V4743 Sgr, Field 7: Intermediate polar cataclysmic variable also studied at X-ray wavelengths (Ness et al., 2003, AJ, 594, L127), with an orbital and spin period of 6.7 hours and 23.6 minutes respectivley.

HETE J1900.1-2455, Field 7: Low mass X-ray binary contain a pulsar (spin period of 377 Hz) with an orbital period of 83.3 minutes. This will be the first of its kind observed with Kepler.

Additional targets might be added from searching the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) or the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) if found to be on silicon and if their magnitudes are found to be suitable (Km<16) for aperiodic variability studies."

Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy.

Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012).  For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission.

The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars.

Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem.

Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013).

Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. A subsample of ~300 (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields 0 to 9 from 2014 to 2016. For fields 6 and 7, observed in 2015, we propose to include ~100 targets in the K2 fields for these campaigns for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them  will fall onto the Kepler chips. For the subsequent fields we will submit similarly sized numbers of objects. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner in the context of a PhD project supervised by all three co-investigators."
GO6062,6,Robert,V,Wagoner,Stanford University,wagoner@stanford.edu,"Odden, Caroline E; Levine, Adam",Probing the Inner Accretion Disk of AGNs via Kepler Power Spectra,"We propose to observe AGNs in Campaign 6.  This field is ideal for extragalactic observations.  Targets will be selected to maximize the fraction of photons in the Kepler band that were emitted from the inner accretion disk. Our major motivation is to search in the power spectra for the analogs of the stable high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in ~8 stellar mass black hole X-ray binaries and one superluminous (~400 solar mass black hole?) X-ray source. The origin of these QPOs is still a mystery, as is the claim (Remillard) that the two highest frequencies are often in a ratio of 3/2. However, they have the potential of providing a clock very close to the horizon (especially for the many black holes with close to maximum angular momentum). Only one (low-frequency) QPO has been seen (in X-rays) in an AGN. However, the continuum power spectra can also provide valuable information about conditions there, as has been demonstrated by the Kepler observations of Edelson et al. and Revalski et al. 
  Using realistic models of accretion disks and photon orbits in the Kerr metric, Levine (as part of his senior thesis) and Wagoner have calculated this fraction from a region where the most robust normal mode could exist, as a function of red shift, black hole mass, spin, and disk inclination. We will consider those AGNs that appear to have luminosities close to the Eddington limit. These calculations will be a major input to our target selection. As an example, the period of this (g-) mode, which is gravitationally trapped near the temperature maximum of the disk, is (11  40) (M/10^8 solar masses) (1+Z) hours (for maximum  zero spin). Large redshifts (Z) are required, since the maximum temperature of the disk is ~ 10^5 K for 10^8 solar masses. We will be employing the 30-minute cadence of Kepler, giving us about 3800 observations. This will be a Small Investigation, with < 100 targets. 
  We plan to involve high school students taught by Caroline Odden in this research. We believe this project will serve as a highly engaging STEM activity for these high school students. Odden teaches an astronomy research course at Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts."
GO6063,6,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Xue, Zhichao",Testing DA White Dwarf Variability: Can They Be Standard Stars?,"Supernova cosmology is a vast and important enterprise, with extensive upcoming ground-based and space-based photometry of supernova light curves, so as to provide the primary measure of Dark Energy. The dominant source of error is now the photometric uncertainty in calibrating the supernova light curves. To advance, better calibrations are needed.  The goal is to get calibrations better than 1%, and hopefully much better than 1%, as such is needed to measure the Dark Energy parameters to the needed precision. The best way to get better standards is to use DA white dwarfs (WDs) in each field as primary standards. With this, only differential photometry is used and the standards will be on-chip with all individual images. As such, substantial effort is being made worldwide to learn to calibrate the DA WDs. A further advantage of DA WDs is that they should be extremely stable standard stars (provided that they are not in close binaries and are not near the ZZ Cet instability strip).

A critical question for this large enterprise is whether DA WDs really are stable?  To be useful for the Dark Energy problem, they have to be nearly all with variability of less than something like 0.1%.  Answering this question is essentially impossible by prior methods.  For example, ground-based methods do not have real accuracy for single measures better than 1% or so (Landolt 2009), and multiple observations have problems with stability.  Even HST cannot be used to provide meaningful tests because the available dwell time on any WD will be too small to detect many types of variability.  The Kepler spacecraft uniquely can answer the question of the amplitude of DA WD variability, because only Kepler has millimag accuracy, awesome stability, and a relentless observing cadence with no gaps for long time spans.

The original Kepler mission observed 11 non-binary DA WDs, all far from the instability strip (Østensen et al. 2011).  These were examined for periodic pulsations, but not for measuring the amplitude of their intrinsic variability.  We have analyzed the 11 light curves from the original Kepler field, correcting for systematic variations and for the usual scatter from Poisson noise.  (We have previously proposed for 6 DA WDs in K2 Fields 4 & 5, but results are not available for these.)  We found that 8 out of 11 stars had intrinsic variations at below the 0.2% level.  But we found the remaining 3 stars to have variations with amplitudes of 0.35%, 0.5%, and 1%, all varying on timescales from half-a-day to 5 days.  This is daunting, because nearly 30% of the DA WDs are too variable to be used for supernova cosmology.  But this result is small-number statistics, and many more systems are needed before anyone can rest the full weight of supernova cosmology and Dark Energy parameters on the DA WDs.

We have selected 4 targets in Field 6 and 1 target in Field 7, as based on the following criteria:  (1) Each must be a spectroscopically confirmed DA WD.  (2) Each must be apparently single and away from the instability strip.  (3) Each must be brighter than 16th mag so that the Poisson noise will be low enough to allow detection of low-amplitude variations even over single time bins.  (4) Each must be definitely on-chip as reported by the K2fov program.

RELEVANCE: One of NASA's top priorities is the measure of Dark Energy, while the supernova cosmology programs desperately need <1% accuracy in their calibration.  DA WDs are currently the best prospects, but it is unknown whether these stars are stable enough.  Only Kepler can measure such variability, and from the original field it looks like ~30% are too variable to use. The increased sample size of  DA WDs from K2 observations will further add to the number of DA WDs observed by the Kepler spacecraft, thus allowing for tighter constraints to be placed on whether they can be standards or not.

GO6065,6,Wei-Chun,,Jao,Georgia State University,jao@chara.gsu.edu,"Henry, Todd J.",Monitoring the Closest Stars in K2 Fields 6 and 7,"The fundamentals of stellar astronomy are built upon studies of nearby stars. Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution. In addition, a detailed understanding of their physical properties (temperatures, radii, masses, etc.) is essential to the effects that stellar hosts have on any exoplanets orbiting them. The RECONS group (www.recons.org) is dedicated to the study of nearby stars. Since 1994, we have discovered and characterized nearby red, brown, and white dwarfs, (Jao et al. 2005, 2014; Henry et al. 2006; Subasavage et al. 2009; Riedel et al. 2014). The team is currently constructing the RECONS 25 Parsec Database, which at present includes more than 3000 stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets with parallaxes greater than 40 mas and errors less than 10 mas. 

Much of the motivation of the K2 mission is to identify potentially habitable planets transiting stars that are close enough for detailed follow-up. Many nearby stars have been targeted for radial velocity (e.g., Chubak et al. 2012), transiting (e.g., Berta et al. 2013), and high-resolution imaging surveys (e.g., Horch et al 2012) to find close companions or planets. We propose to utilize the temporal monitoring in K2 fields 6 and 7 to observe the 6 nearest systems (including 7 components) with trigonometric parallaxes placing them closer than 25 pc. These stars are K5  M4 dwarfs and a white dwarf, a sample which covers the most abundant populations of our Galaxy. Of particular interest is the GJ0729 (M3.5V), which is the 9th closest star in our solar neighborhood.

Keplers long and short cadence data will allow us to search for transiting exoplanets around these nearby stars, none of which have yet been found to harbor planets.  To date, there are 978 confirmed planets discovered by Kepler, yet the closest planet, Kep-3b, is at 33 pc. Most of the systems either do not have parallaxes or are farther than 100 pc.  Although the odds of detecting a transit among only 7 targets is small, the variability data are valuable for astrophysical studies of the nearest stars and an investment in the future, should non-transiting planets eventually be discovered around these stars.  Month-long monitoring of the M dwarfs in particular can provide context for continuing RECONS work on M dwarf variability over timescales of 3-12 years, sampled at observing cadences of a few times/year (Jao et al. 2011; Hosey et al. 2014, accepted). In these studies we find that only 10% of M dwarfs vary by more than 20 mmag at optical wavelengths, implying that most M dwarfs are suitable for stable planetary environments.  These two campaigns are both in the south and can be observed at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m, where the RECONS variability data are taken.  Thus, we can set-up a complementary long-term variability monitoring program in conjunction to Keplers short-term data and will gather a full picture of the stars variability and flaring events, which are important to habitability of planets. We note that this proposal is similar to the one we submit for field 4 and 5 to observe 21 stars, which is currently under review."
GO6069,6,David,,Charbonneau,Harvard University Dept of Astronomy,dcharbonneau@cfa.harvard.edu,"Dressing, Courtney D; Dumusque, Xavier; Buchhave, Lars A; Latham, David W.; Vanderburg, Andrew; Lopez-Morales, Mercedes; Johnson, John Asher",Characterizing Small K2 Planets with the HARPS-N Spectrograph,"Follow-up studies of the small planets detected by Kepler have revealed a remarkable diversity of planet densities, indicating that predicting planetary properties from a radius measurement alone could lead to significant errors in our estimate of the frequency of rocky (and possibly habitable) worlds. We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2 and conducting follow-up high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models.

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date (Fields 0-5) is small.

We will propose a list of roughly 4000 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We searched for all V < 12 stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 6, which is accessible to HARPS-N. We then used the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. 

We will identify promising planet candidates in K2 photometry using the planet detection pipeline developed by team members Vanderburg and Johnson. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities. 

The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 40 nights per year of guaranteed time specifically devoted to observations of small planets detected by Kepler and K2. PI D. Charbonneau is chair of the HARPS-N Science Team and the Target Selection Team. 

We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves, reconnaissance imaging, and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. 

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a tremendous impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful background information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."
GO6071,6,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,"Rotation rates and ages of stars in wide binary systems, and a search for hierarchical triples","Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and chemical composition. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested  by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated (which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are). Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 6 and 7, we have identified a total of 77 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 45 seconds of arc. Our statistical analysis indicates that at least 70% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignment of unrelated stars). Half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. Most secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, most pairs can also be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target. One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, and thus a significant fraction of wide binaries are actually hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or event contact) binary star; we can test this prediction in our sample by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries. Relevance: this program will provide data on a set of important calibrators of stellar evolution models, which will have repercussions on the methods presently used to estimate the ages of low-mass stars - from which the ages of many exoplanet systems discovered by the Kepler mission are now evaluated."
GO6072,6,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,,Identifying Distant Halo Giants in High-Latitude Fields with K2: C6,"The stellar content and structure of the Galactic halo constrain star formation at the earliest epochs, and halo mass and assembly. The best remote tracers are K giants, for their high luminosities render them visible to 100 kpc, and their presence in populations of all metallicities and ages ensure an unbiased sample. However, the difficulty of separating distant giants from foreground dwarfs at faint magnitudes has led to choosing preferentially metal-poor giant candidates. Our goal here is to use K2 light curves, which lack this bias, to identify two hundred giants 10  100 kpc above the Galactic plane in lightly-reddened areas at high Galactic latitude.

This proposal is relevant to the Kepler K2 Guest Observer solicitation because new K2 observations are the only means of doing this without invoking an explicit low-metallicity bias. Previous identification relies on spectra or photometric indices to select candidates for scarce follow-up resources; such criteria are vital to increase the odds of finding halo giants. K2 does not need this, as it can identify all cool giants from their light curves, and can record a thousand potential targets at once. Kepler could as well, but the Kepler field was centered at low Galactic latitude, b = +13.5º, a line of sight that remains close to the Galactic plane. Reddening is significant and variable, and halo giants are swamped by dwarfs of the disk/thick disk. Existing K2 data in the high-latitude fields C1 and C3 include very few suitable STAR targets. Obtaining new K2 data in the upcoming K2 high-latitude fields C6, C8, C10, and C12 now offers a unique opportunity to identify a total of a thousand giants lying 10 to 100 kpc above the Galactic plane without explicit color or line-strength cuts based on metallicity.

We propose K2 C6 long-cadence observations of ~1050 distant giant candidates at Galactic latitude b from 48° to 53°, with E(g-r) ~ 0.04. These include all on-silicon EPIC stars with SDSS ugriz photometry, 0.60 <= g-r < 1.06, proximity > 12 if given, and proper motion < 13 mas/yr. These targets all have 16 <~ Kp <~ 18, too faint for direct GAIA or APOGEE spectroscopy. The faint Kp limit, required for peak detection in a giant power spectrum, is based on Kepler light curves of APOGEE metal-poor giants and a K2 precision of 1% in 30min at Kp = 17.5. A check on peak detectability and the resulting parameters comes from C6 targets having SEGUE spectra, namely 16 dwarfs and 15 giants.

The peak frequency nu_max of maximum power of p-mode (solar-like) oscillations scales as gravity g/sqrt(Teff). At 0.56 < (g-r)o < 1.02, such giants have 200 >~ nu_max >~ 1¼Hz and temperature Teff from 5100 to 4200K. As dwarfs show no peaks here (or recognizable ones), and metal-poor subgiants and red clump stars are bluer, nu_max alone can separate giants from interlopers. nu_max will be found to 10% from power spectra derived from the K2 80-day light curves (from the positions of the strongest peaks near the high- frequency cutoff), and Teff to < 100K (from g-r). These will fix the luminosity of a giant to ~20%, and be confirmed via globular- cluster ugriz diagrams and existing results for individual stars. Follow-up spectroscopy of these distant giants (and dwarfs) to improve their parameters need observe but a small sky area, 4 sq deg, accessible to both UVES FLAMES and Keck DEIMOS.

We will publish a catalogue of all stars detected, with our values of nu_max, luminosity, distance, Teff, and log g, plus metallicity [Fe/H] for cooler stars (estimated from ugriz color-color plots). For added value, we will provide a grid of high-resolution spectra calculated from first principles for metal-poor giants. From these, Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] may be derived from optical spectra of moderate or high resolution for metal-poor giants in regions of both low and high reddening. This will provide important standardized input for K2/Kepler metal-poor giant seismology and other NASA investigations."
GO6074,6,Geraldine,J,Peters,University of Southern California,gjpeters@mucen.usc.edu,"Wilson, R. E.",Gas Stream Dynamics in Algol-Type Interacting Binary Systems,"Scientific Goals: We propose K2 (long cadence) observations of eclipsing binary systems in Fields 6 and 7 to study the dynamics of mass transfer in interacting binaries of the Algol type. The project is inspired by our discovery of  a new class of short-period interacting binaries during Kepler Cycles 1-4.   Kepler  observation revealed that several systems with Algol-like light curves display unequal brightness at their quadrature phases and that the quadrature brightness ratio varies from  > 1 to <1 on a time scale of about 100-400 days (http://nexsci.caltech.edu/conferences/KeplerII/posters/peters.pdf). To our knowledge such behavior has never been reported from ground-based photometry.  We call these binaries L/T (Leading/Trailing hemisphere) variables.  The variability is likely due to changes in the sizes, temperatures, and locations of either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the location of the impact site and its migration serve as a diagnostic of stream dynamics in mass transferring Algols.  From new observations of Algols and related eclipsing binaries in K2 Fields 6 and 7, we will secure data that will characterize the location/motion of hot accretion spots. The location of impact site and the nature of its azimuthal motion will indicate whether the stream is magnetically-controlled or purely a result of hydrodynamic flow. Our investigation is part of a wider study of the detailed physics of mass transfer in Algols.

Number of Targets: 40 to 50 including Fields 6 & 7
We searched the regions centered on Fields 6 & 7 for eclipsing binaries with EA (eclipsing Algols) and  EB (eclipsing binaries of the beta Lyr type) designations using a 9.0º search radius. Several catalogs of variable stars were consulted including  Avvakumova et al. (2013), Malkov et al. (2006), Budding et al. (2004), the General Catalog of Variable Stars (Samus et al. 2013), and Simbad.  Systems with Kepler magnitudes between 6.0-14.0 were considered candidates for observation. There are several systems with Kepler magnitudes in the 8-10 range, for which K2 will yield an excellent S/N.

Methodology: As in our continuing project on the L/T variables in the Kepler Field, the K2 light curves will be modeled with the Wilson-Devinney (WD) program (Wilson & Devinney 1971, Wilson 2012 and references therein).  Stellar and spot parameters are determined.  We are currently exploring whether a migrating hot accretion spot on the primary and/or cool spots on the secondary can explain the quadrature light variability.

Relevance to the Solicitation: Only with the continuous photometric coverage of high precision provided by K2 can one identify binaries with unequal quadrature light and study the L/T phenomenon, as the variations are less  than 3% of the quadrature flux. One needs a continuous train of eclipse data over many orbital cycles to characterize the variability, including degree of the flux variations and its phase dependence.

Widely used in the asteroseismology of red giants, asteroseismic scaling relations connect stellar properties such as masses and radii to easy-to-derive seismic parameters such as the frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation. Although scaling relations do have some theoretical justification, they are still mostly based on the only star whose parameters we truly know: the Sun. The precise seismic K2 observations coupled with high-quality ground-based interferometric and spectroscopic data of bright nearby giants will allow us to subject the scaling relations to the most demanding tests. 
The second application is to constrain the poorly understood mixing processes working inside red giants, such as thermohaline mixing, rotation, and deep circulation. These processes are predicted to have different impact at different stages of red giant evolution, and to leave imprints in the surface chemical composition of a star. Precise seismic log (g) from K2 time series, coupled with high resolution spectroscopy, will allow for a detailed abundance determination of a large number of chemical species.  The correlations between elements (e.g. [C/ Fe] vs [N/ Fe]) and departure from their theoretically predicted values (as in the case of Li or 12 C/13 C) are tracers of internal mixing processes, and will be studied as a function of the seismically determined mass.
The third goal of this proposal is to address one of the biggest uncertainties in stellar astrophysics: the abundance of helium in stars. The helium second ionization zone inside a star produces an abrupt change in the local sound speed, which is detectable in the Fourier spectrum of time series as a periodic variation. We will construct detailed models of red giants where this variation is detected, and coupled with independent constraints on angular diameter and detailed surface composition, we will put stringent constraints on the helium abundance of red giants and test our assumptions on enrichment laws of the Galaxy.
We have selected ~25 bright (Kp~5-8) red giants which are ideally suited for this project due to their precisely determined distances, large angular sizes for interferometry, and detectable oscillations in the 80 day K2 baseline. Red giants observed by Kepler were generally too faint to meet these criteria, making K2 uniquely suited to perform these observations. Our proposal addresses compelling questions in stellar structure and evolution, and is hence directly related to the K2 GO solicitation."

We propose a Large K2 Program to monitor ~ 3,500 bright (r < 18 mag, z < 0.08) galaxies in Campaign 6 (and abstaining from Campaign 7) which should yield, about 7 extremely well-sampled light curves (LCs) of supernovae. To date, we have identified 6 supernovae events in our Kepler GO programs and also found that ~ 4% of galaxies observed by Kepler show AGN-like activity (variability at > 0.001% level). We plan to: A) Determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe using features in the early (t < 4 days) LCs; B) Explore the explosion physics of SN Ia using subtle features during its rise (t < 20 days); C) Improve the calibration of SN Ia for measuring distances and dark energy by creating a sample of well measured SN Ia LCs with unprecedented detail. D) In nearby galaxies, look for fast (t > 10 day) and faint (M < -15) transients in a new range of parameter space provided only by K2; and E) Add significantly to the virtually unexplored low-Eddington regime of AGN.  

What triggers a white dwarf to explode as a SN Ia is unsolved. Does it accrete from a companion star or does it merge with another WD? If it accretes from a companion star, shock emission, as the explosion hits the star, would be observable (Kasen 2010). That emission will be short lived and strongest from certain viewing angles, requiring a rapid observing cadence and several SNe before strong conclusions can be reached. With two SN Ia discovered by our previous Kepler monitoring of ~ 500 galaxies (Olling et al. 2015), tight constraints were placed on the systems. With a larger sample, we could determine what the progenitors of SN Ia are. Meanwhile, features due to the different explosion physics (detonation, deflagration, inwards-moving diffusion waves, etc) of Ia and core collapse SNe will be revealed. K2 allows us, for the first time, to test models that are more complicated than the simple ""expanding fireballs.""

Our program will improve the calibration of SN Ia's for cosmology by reducing uncertainties in distance measurements. By determining the key parameters needed for distance fitting (light-curve width, maximum, and the explosion time) on the scale of minutes rather than days, we can improve the precision of distances and dark energy as a function of redshift.  

We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe the entire field every other day using SkyMapper and ATLAS Pathfinder. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify the transients using PESSTO, and existing programs at Siding Spring, Lick, Gemini, and Keck. These data, coupled with high precision 30 min K2 data will have great legacy value.

In addition, in the nearby galaxies, this program will also be sensitive to LBV- and nova-like eruptions, tidal shredding of stars or other material by super-massive black holes, and other still unknown types of faint, fast transients."
GO6078,6,Ji,,Wang,Yale University,ji.wang@yale.edu,"Fischer, Debra Ann; Huang, Xu",Searching For Planets In Binary Stars,"Prior to the launch of the Kepler mission, we already knew that there are hundreds of binary stars in its field of view. For these binary stars, we find a striking deficiency of planets; none of these binary stars has a planet candidate. With K2 mission, we propose to observe more known binary stars to confirm the deficiency. We consider only S-type circumstellar planet system, in which a planet orbits one of the binary stars, NOT circumbinary planets (P-type).

Our sample consists of 1500 binary stars, which represents the largest sample of binary stars for planet search. This sample will put a strong constraint on the planet occurrence rate in binary stars, which we denote as f. We calculate f for different number of planet detections. Non-detection will give a 3-sigma upper limit of f at 9.5%, which confirms the deficiency and the suppressive influence of a stellar companion on planet formation. One or two detections will confirm the deficiency at 2-3 sigma level. More than two detections are deemed as unlikely given the Kepler main mission result.

Targeting binary stars with no prior information of planet helps to unambiguously address the planet occurrence rate in binary stars. Increasing the sample size helps not only to confirm the deficiency of planets in binary stars but also study the influence of stellar companions on planets with different sizes and orbital separations. Future NASA mission in search of habitable worlds will inevitably encounter with this question: to select binary stars or not, which account for 33% of stars in the solar neighborhood. This proposal will pave the way to solve this question."
GO6081,6,Daniel,,Huber,SETI Institute,daniel.huber@nasa.gov,"White, Timothy R; Aerts, Conny Clara; Silva Aguirre, Victor",Asteroseismology of the Brightest K2 Stars,"Science Goals and Objectives: The most powerful test of our understanding of stellar structure and evolution comes from the brightest stars in the night sky, for which complementary observational techniques (such as astrometry, asteroseismology, and interferometry) can be combined. So far, stars brighter than V < 5 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 long-cadence observations of the 10 brightest (V ~ 1-5 mag) K2 stars in campaign 6 & 7 using a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels (equivalent to 20 12th magnitude G-type stars per target). Asteroseismic studies of these bright targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for K giants and insights into poorly understood internal physical processes in A and B stars such convective core overshooting and internal differential rotation.

Methodology: Our targets will be selected from the Hipparcos catalog using a V < 5 mag cut, which yields 10 targets that fall on silicon in Campaign 6 and 7 (including Spica, a V=1 binary system with a 4 day period, ellipsoidal variability, and a gamma Cepheid variable primary component with a 4.2 hour pulsation period). We will use small (~20x20 pixel) circular apertures around the saturated core for each target, and perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method has been demonstrated to successfully recover pulsations of stars observed in K2 Campaign 0, as well as oscillations in saturated giants observed by Kepler. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Relevance to Solicitation: The proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics and the study of bright stars, both of which are key science goals of the K2 mission. In addition to pulsations, we expect to detect other astrophysical variability such as rotational modulation and ellipsoidal variations, which will give new insights into the physical nature and evolution of these bright stars. Additionally, our project may serendipitously yield the discovery of the brightest transiting exoplanet host star to date, in line with the key K2 science goal of detecting transits around bright stars."
GO6082,6,Katrien,,Kolenberg,University of Vienna,katrien.kolenberg@gmail.com,"Szabo, Robert; Molnar, Laszlo; Plachy, Emese; Banyai, Evelin",Investigating different populations of RR Lyrae stars with K2,"ABSTRACT:  RR Lyrae stars play a crucial role in astrophysics as standard candles, tracers of galactic history, and touchstones for modelling stellar pulsations. Space data of these crucial objects have led to a giant leap forward in our understanding of their structure and evolution, through the discovery of new dynamical phenomena. Moreover, insight into these stars dynamics is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. In this proposal we plan to study roughly 200-200 RR Lyrae stars in long cadence and 5-5 in short cadence in K2 Fields 6&7. Field 7 contains both galactic RR Lyraes and members of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream (Cseresnjes 2011, A&A 375, 909), and offers a unique chance to study two distinctly different populations. Moreover, K2's unique long, uninterrupted, high-precision space photometry, allows us conduct galactic structure studies and to improve our understanding of RR Lyrae pulsation and dynamics.

RESEARCH GOALS: 1. Throughout the K2 Mission we are building up a unique database from field to field covering different parts of our Galaxy and beyond (the Sgr dwarf galaxy in Field 7). Such an unprecedented photometric RR Lyrae sample will form the base of galactic structure studies and near-field cosmology. We will study the Galactic structure and history by obtaining distances to RR Lyrae stars and determine their spatial distribution (halo streams, over-densities). 2. The samples of K2 RR Lyrae data allow for a statistical analysis of various dynamical phenomena (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko-modulation, period-doubling, low-dimensional chaos, nonradial modes) and their occurrence rates to better understand their origin and their effect on distance determination. This can only be accomplished with K2. (In the nominal Kepler mission we had around 50 RR Lyrae stars on silicon.) 3. We will perform a detailed analysis of all RR Lyrae light curves, especially overtone and classical double-mode pulsators. The original Kepler field contained no RRd stars, and only a few RRc. This will aid the investigation of dynamical phenomena (resonances, mode interactions) that may be important in other types of pulsating stars, but can be studied in detail only in large-amplitude stars and with space photometry.

METHODS: We produce light curves from target pixel data (PyKE and own software), then apply corrections, trend-filtering, outlier removal, etc. Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. We derive metallicities from empirical relations using the light curve shapes and spectroscopic observations. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will help to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations. Targets. ~200 RR Lyrae stars will be proposed per field (5-5 for short cadence observations). Due to their distances, RR Lyrae stars are faint, the majority between 15-19 Kepler mag.

EXPERIENCE: Our team consists of members of the Working Group#7 (RR Lyrae and Cepheids) of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, who have been working on Kepler data (also preparation and target selection) since the launch of the nominal mission. We have experts on data reduction, pixel photometry, light curve and time-frequency analysis, as well as theorists performing numerical hydrodynamical modeling.

We propose short-cadence observations of known and high-probability pulsating WDs within the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. We additionally propose observations of known magnetic WDs to constrain magnetic activity and rotation rates in these stars.

As they cool, WDs stars with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres pulsate as DAVs (a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) when they reach the appropriate effective temperature to foster a hydrogen partial-ionization zone, which efficiently drives global oscillations. This range of temperatures empirically spans roughly 12,60011,100 K for typical-mass (0.6 Msun), log g = 8.0 WDs (Gianninas et al. 2011, ApJ, 743, 138). Pulsating WDs provide an important glimpse into the interior of the future of the vast majority (> 97%) of all stars in our Galaxy, including our Sun, allowing us to probe the masses and compositions of their electron-degenerate cores, as well as of their non-degenerate envelopes; to determine their internal rota- tion profiles; and to detect weak magnetic fields (see reviews by Winget & Kepler 2008 (ARA&A, 46, 157) and Fontaine & Brassard 2008 (PASP, 120, 1043).

Since the ZZ Ceti instability strip is defined by temperature, color selection is an excellent predictor of variability. Our team discovered all DAVs in the original Kepler mission, which has led to exquisite insight into WD interiors. We have applied the same photometric selection methods to K2 Fields 6 & 7, and have identified several WDs on silicon with colors consistent with the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. Since there is little SDSS overlap with K2 Fields 6 & 7, we have searched for new candidates using u', g', r' colors from the VST/ATLAS survey in the regions overlapping with Field 6 (no ATLAS data exists for Field 7). We have also searched for candidate DAVs from WDs with appropriate colors in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (Rowell & Hambly 2011, MNRAS, 417, 93); this is how we discovered the first DAV in the original Kepler field (Hermes et al. 2011, ApJ, 741, L16). There is also one previously known, bright pulsating WD on silicon in Field 6: the DAV EC140121446 (V =15.5 mag).

Every new DAV we can observe with Kepler adds value, since it brings us that much closer to sta- tistically significant studies of WDs with ensemble asteroseismology (e.g. Chaplin et al. 2011, Science, 332, 213). To date, there are only six pulsating WDs with more than two weeks of Kepler observations, although several were observed in K2 Field 1. With typical pulsations ranging from 100  1400 s, we require short-cadence observations of these WDs. We expect to propose roughly 4 DAVs for Field 6 and 2 DAVs for Field 7. Minute-cadence K2 observations have the added benefit of catching transits/eclipses of the WD, revealing any unresolved double-degenerate binaries or even planetary companions.

Additionally, we propose observations of multiple strongly magnetic WDs in Fields 6 and 7 to carry out the first in-depth study into the magnetic activity of the endpoints of stellar evolution."

Due to their diversity in fundamental properties (masses, luminosities, chemical compositions), RGB stars are ideal targets to tackle two key unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of host star mass, and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets. We propose a survey of ~2000 low-luminosity RGB stars (with radii between ~3.5-8 solar radii) using long-cadence data to detect transiting gas-giant planets with K2 and address the above science questions by combining exoplanet transits and asteroseismology.

Methodology: Targets will be selected using colors and reduced proper motions. Planet candidates will be detected using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since RGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planet candidates. 

Relevance to Solicitation: The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing bright low-luminosity RGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

The primary goal is to generate a catalog of planet candidates for prioritization of SETI searches.  Secondary goals are to provide a well vetted sample of planet candidates to the community to follow up for asteroseismic or spectroscopic stellar characterization and radial velocity confirmation.

While M dwarfs offer some unique advantages, it is important to search for, characterize and understand exoplanets smaller than Neptune around stars closer in spectral type to our own. We propose to use K2 to carry out a search for transits of small planets around bright F, G and K stars. Small planets in such systems will be well suited to follow-up with radial velocity in order to determine their masses thanks to the brightness of the host stars. Stars with spectral types from late F to K should have sufficiently low vsini values, but also lower activity levels than M stars, therefore being ideal for RV measurements. They will also be suitable targets for atmospheric studies, and will make up a valuable sample for understanding how the structures, atmospheric compositions and orbital properties of these planets vary as a function of stellar spectral type. Ultimately, these measurements will enable us to constrain the formation and evolution of these planetary systems.

Target selection and expected yield: For our target selection, we began with all stars from the EPIC that fall on silicon during campaigns 6 and 7. We only kept stars with Kepler magnitudes brighter than 12 to ensure the ability to obtain mass determinations for the expected small transiting planets using high resolution spectrographs such as HARPS and HIRES. These systems will also be sufficiently bright to be accessible to current and upcoming space telescopes such as the HST, Spitzer, JWST and CHEOPS. Using a B-V colour cut, we then filtered out stars of types earlier than mid-F (B-V < 0.5) and later than M (B-V > 1.4). We further removed likely giants and subgiants by filtering out stars with proper motions smaller than 4 mas/yr. Our final sample of targets includes 2134 and 6838 stars in campaigns 6 and 7, respectively. From occurrence studies based on Kepler statistics of small planets around FGK stars, we expect to discover of the order of 70 new small planets during campaigns 6 and 7 as part of this survey.

Methodology: The majority of the targets we propose will be saturated. However, it has been demonstrated on both Kepler and K2 data that high-precision photometry is achievable even for saturated stars by using larger, customized apertures to ensure collection of all the light bled down columns and into adjacent pixels. We will use a similar method to extract photometry for saturated stars. Because centroiding will be difficult for those targets, we will use the pixel position of a nearby star to de-correlate the pixel position from the target photometry, an important step in analysing K2 data.

Relevance to ROSES 2014 and K2 GO - Cycle 1 solicitations: This proposal addresses the following NASA and K2 objectives and motivations: understand how small exoplanets form and determine the incidence of planets able to support life in the Universe. Specifically, this program will provide numerous bright systems hosting small planets amenable to follow-up studies that, together with the K2 data, will place constraints on their formation. It will also assess the composition and diversity of small planets around solar-type stars, thereby contributing to our understanding of how common life is in the Universe."
GO7001,7,Steven,,Kawaler,Iowa State University,sdk@iastate.edu,,Search for rotational modulation in precise photometry of white dwarf stars,"This program will use very sensitive photometric observations of white dwarfs by Kepler/K2 to search for rotational modulation of the flux from low-magnetic field white dwarf stars caused by magnetic phenomena (such as starspots and plages). On the expected white dwarf rotation periods (about 1 day, generalizing from nonradially pulsating white dwarfs), the low amplitude of the expected variations renders them extremely difficult to detect using ground-based photometry. K2 will be able to observe many well-studied field (and cluster) white dwarfs. Measurement of rotation modulation (or even upper limits to photometric amplitude variations) will further exploit those data to teach us about magnetic fields in these stars that are otherwise inaccessible observationally. In the nonradially pulsating white dwarfs, we can independently measure the rotation rate, providing a test of asteroseismic rotation periods."
GO7002,7,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,bod21@cam.ac.uk,"Gillon, Michael; Huber, Daniel; Queloz, Didier Patrick",Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types from M0 to L8, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such an exoplanet has not been discovered yet. As of today, K2 is the only facility that provides the required stability and photometric precision to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0, 1, 2 and 3 observations.

SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.

High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).

RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.

METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 6 and 7, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on the M-dwarf bright star catalog of Lepine & Gaidos in one hand and a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series. The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on the K2 engineering data of February 2014 and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program. We already found several planet candidates in that dataset.

EXPECTED YIELD. Our target list is still in preparation. We expect to assemble a list of 110 to 190 bright ultra-cool dwarfs for fields 6 and 7. 

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."
GO7003,7,Mukremin,,Kilic,University of Oklahoma,kilic@ou.edu,"Loeb, Abraham; Agol, Eric; Mullally, Fergal; Debes, John Henry",A Search for Habitable Planets Around White Dwarfs in Fields 6 and 7,"The search for planets in the habitable zone has so far focused on solar-type stars and M dwarfs. However, transiting planets in the habitable zone around white dwarfs (WDs) may be common (Agol 2011, ApJ, 731, L31) and they provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on an exoplanet (Loeb & Maoz 2013, MNRAS, 432, L11). The habitable zone around WDs extends from 0.005 AU to 0.02 AU (P = 4-30 h, Agol 2011) for WDs older than about 1 Gyr. Since WDs are slightly larger than Earth, Earth-size and even smaller planets can easily be detected. We expect the planets within 1 AU of solar type stars to be destroyed in the giant phase. Hence, planets in the habitable zone around WDs must arrive there after this phase. There are several ways to form such planets near the WD or bring them closer (see the Kepler white paper by our team; arXiv:1309.0009). Planets have been detected around evolved, post-main-sequence stars. In addition, tidally disrupted asteroids and dwarf planets have been detected around 4.3% of WDs in the form of debris disks (Barber et al. 2012, ApJ, 760, 26). If the history of exoplanet science has taught us anything, it is that planets are ubiquitous and they exist in the most unusual places, including very close to their host stars and even around pulsars.

Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability of the Kepler 2 mission to perform a transit survey of the WDs in Fields 6 and 7. Using spectroscopy, photometry, and astrometry data from the McCook & Sion White Dwarf catalog, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the SuperCosmos Sky Survey, we identify about 150 WDs in Fields 6 and 7. We propose LC observations of all WD targets.

SC observations would have the best constraints on transiting planets around WDs. However, given the small number of SC slots available, LC mode data will still enable us to achieve our science goals. Planets in the habitable zone would eclipse their stars for about 2 min. Hence, the LC mode data will dilute the transit signal by a factor of 15. However, since the transit depth is >50% for an Earth-size or bigger planet around an average size WD, these transits will have >3% depth in the LC data, and they will still be visible. Even with the decreased sensitivity of the 2wheel mode, Kepler can still detect transits of Earth-size or bigger planets around WDs.

The probability for a transit by an Earth-size planet at 0.01 AU is 1%. Hence, the discovery of habitable planets around WDs requires a survey of at least 100 targets, if all of them have such planets. Previously, we proposed for K2 observations of 560 target WDs in Fields 0-5. The addition of the 150 WDs from Fields 4 and 5 will bring the total number of WDs surveyed by the K2 mission to 700. This survey will provide the first constraints on the frequency of habitable planets around WDs. The survey sample size will grow as the number of observed K2 fields increases. Our proposed survey is relatively cheap due to the relatively small number of WD targets in Fields 6 and 7 . On the other hand, this survey is capable of finding the first planets in the WD habitable zone, and the James Webb Space Telescope is capable of obtaining the first spectroscopic measurements of such planets (Loeb & Maoz 2013).

In addition to the transit search, the 30-min cadence of the LC data is well suited for measuring the rotation periods for a large number of WDs for the first time. WDs have typical rotation periods of a few hours to a few days (Kawaler 2004, IAU #215), though there are only a handful of measurements available. Kepler's precision provides an excellent opportunity to measure the rotation periods for our targets, including the ones with relatively weak magnetic fields (McQuillan et al. 2014, ApJS, 211, 24)."

However, flares from stars much less massive than the Sun are more common. At the start of K2 we initiated a project to observe late type stars with a range of spectral type to determine how the flare activity depended on physical properties such as mass and rotation period and hence gain a better understanding of the underlying physics of flares. Our work will also have implications for determining how flares can effect the habitability of any exoplanets orbiting their parent star. We will select up to a dozen targets in Fields 6 and in 7 and will cover M and early L spectral types. Since some flares can last only a few to tens of mins we will request short cadence mode data for some targets."

timescale of hours and weather evolution of the clouds on timescales from days to months. Magnetic activity changes dramatically
at the stellar/substellar hydrogen-burning limits, but some ultracool dwarfs are known to flare. We will measure the white light
flare rate in well-defined statistical samples as a function of effective temperature, rotation rate, and age. Flares are tied to magnetic
reconnection rates and the energy budget. We also aim to detect transiting exoplanets by continuing to monitor each available
ultracool dwarf in K2 campaigns; brown dwarfs, gas giants, and even large rocky planets are detectable. The K2 targets include nearby field late-M and L dwarfs. The Phase 2 proposal will include fewer than 50 long-cadence targets and  10 short-cadence targets in the two fields."
GO7007,7,Marina,,Orio,University of Wisconsin,orio@astro.wisc.edu,,The calm after the storm: quiescent novae and symbiotics,"Hydrogen burning white dwarfs in accreting binaries are among the most intriguing astrophysical objects, possibly on the evolutionary path towards a type Ia supernova explosion. I propose obtaining the light curves of a group of quiescent white dwarf systems (the classical novae V4743 Sgr and V363 Sgr and five symbiotic stars) and of the ""red nova"" V4332 Sgr, all  to be observed  in Kepler field 7. The novae and two of the symbiotic stars  (FN SAgr and MWC 960) should be monitored with the 1 minute cadence, while for the other objects, including three symbiotics  (AS 316, AS 327 and V2601 Sgr)  that  appear to be  only ""near silicon"" and should be observed only if it turns out to be feasible, the 30 minutes cadence is requested. 
I plan to use timing analysis techniques to derive periodicities  of the order of minutes and hours, including the still unknown rotation periods of the white dwarfs, which  are very significant to better understand the evolution of these systems.
 In the 1 minute cadence datasets, also the stochastic variability will be measured. Flickering revealing a direct connection with the mass transfer rate, as it has already been inferred for a few cataclysmic variables in previously obtained Kepler data, by obtaining multi-component power density spectra. The amplitude of the broad-band flickering is correlated with the flux, which is in turn dependent  the mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf.
All the data I propose to obtain will be very important and significant  in order to understand the evolution of these intriguing binaries. One of the novae, V4743 Sgr, has been observed in outburst in 2002-2003 and shortly thereafter, in optical and X-rays, revealing variability patterns that are still puzzling the theoreticians. Several  detailed articles on the timing behavior of this nova in outburst and in quiescence have been written by mine and other groups,  addressing the periodic modulations  and quasi-periodic oscillations on timescales of the order of minutes and hours. We will verify how the observed periodicities evolve with time, how they differ in optical and in X-rays,  and  will make significant theoretical progress by  understanding the physical evolution of this unusual nova.  V4743 Sgr is particularly interesting also because it hosts a highly magnetized white dwarf (it is in fact an ""intermediate polar""). The  Kepler light curves of this intriguing nova should allow a breakthrough in understanding the evolutionary role of the white dwarf magnetic field and how it influences accretion and thermonuclear burning. 
  The other nova of our sample has not had an outburst since 1927, thus it is a key system to study how novae settle back into quiescent evolution after many years, and how mass transfer continues almost a century since the outburst.  The two  symbiotics that fall ""on silicon"" host two of the hottest white dwarfs ever observed, which seem to be burning hydrogen in a shell. These objects are on a path to a recurrent nova,  to type Ia supernova outburst, or both. The ""red nova"" of our sample is instead a different type of binary system, a rare and unusual one, whose evolution is not well understood yet, but is crucial for the development of stellar evolution theories.  Also in this case the Kepler light curve  will be crucial in understanding the physical parameters of the system.
 The goals of this investigation are fully consistent with the 2014 NASA strategic plan of discovering how the universe works, and exploring how it evolves, by studying the origin and evolution of binary stars."

These deep transits also increase the potential for subsequent atmospheric characterization. The extended Kepler K2 mission provides the opportunity to monitor tens-of-thousands of nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise, long-cadence photometry and discover a new population of rocky and potentially habitable planets and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit spectroscopy. We propose to observe 8006 M dwarfs in the K2 campaign 6 and 7 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate hundreds of small planets around M dwarfs from the full K2-MDP program. This new population of planets will drastically increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems, improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected from the SUPERBLINK proper-motion database on the basis of high proper-motion and photometric colors. This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs within 100pc of the Sun from this deep (95% complete to V =19) catalog with little contamination. Our targets have median brightness Kp<16, most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC. We prioritize our targets using expected transit S/N, determined by comparing K2s photometric precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting super-Earth. We estimate transit depths by converting DSS, PanSTARRS 1, 2MASS, and WISE photometry to spectral type and then to radius and temperature. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date. The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward these goals and draws on considerable experience from Kepler. We have so far had successful target proposals for K2 fields 04 (GOs 0120, 1036, 2107, and 3107), have been awarded a 70- night ESO Large Program for spectroscopic follow-up of candidate planet hosts (PID 194.C-0443) along with many nights of high-precision AO and RV followup at Lick, Palomar, LBT, and Keck.

The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims to exploit the strengths of the K2 mission design to reveal hundreds of small planets around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-like planets and planets suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky planets and key transit spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) leading up to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; months before the launch of TESS."
GO7010,7,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transits,"To date nothing is known about the final (WD) configuration of >95% of planetary systems! While not a single bona-fide planet has been identified orbiting an isolated WD (Faedi+2011,MNRAS 410, 899), it is now widely accepted that the dusty and/or gaseous disks that we see within one solar radius around many WDs are produced by the tidal disruption of asteroids (Farihi+2010, MNRAS 404, 2123). An increasing fraction of WDs (>=27%) show a metal enrichment due to the fall into the WD atmosphere of ancient planetary material (Koester+2014, A&A 566, 34), whose chemical composition is similar to that seen in different Solar-system meteorites (Gansicke et al. 2012, MNRAS 424, 333).
Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and the AGB phases (Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). While Gaia will discover WD planets at several AUs from their host stars, those external to the period gap (Silvotti et al. 2014, arXiv1412.3307), this proposal aims to study the inner boundary of the period gap. Substellar companions to sdB stars offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion, thermal pulses and PN ejection, Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ 761, 121), and they represent the natural 1st step to study the post-RGB evolution of planetary systems and their final architecture. Star/planet interactions during the RGB may be responsible for the stellar envelope ejection leading to the formation of a single sdB star (Soker 1998, AJ 116, 1308; Han+2012, PASP Conf.Ser. 452, 3).
Among 18 planet/BD candidates around sdB stars (Silvotti+2014, ASP Conf.Ser. 481, 13), 2 planetary systems were detected by Kepler measuring the photometric modulation due to reflection/re-emission of the star light (Charpinet+2011, Nature 480, 496; Silvotti+2014, A&A 570, 130). Given that only 15 sdBs were observed by Kepler for enough time to detect tiny photometric variations of 20-50 ppm, we can assume that 2/15 of sdBs have Earth-size bodies in tight orbits at ~0.005 AU from the star. With a geometric transit probability of 0.2 (Rp<<RsdB, RsdB=0.001 AU), the prob. to see a transit is about 0.027, i.e., in average, we need to observe ~40 sdB stars to see one transit. An even higher transit prob. is obtained for the more massive companions detected through RVs: Geier+2012 (ASP Conf.Ser. 452, 153) found that 16% of their sample of 27 single-lined sdBs do show small RV variations compatible with massive substellar companions. Here the geom. transit probability at 0.005 AU is ~0.28 (Rp=0.9 Rjup) so that, in average, 1 sdB out of ~22 should show transits and secondary eclipses.
The main goal of this proposal is to detect sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targetting in SC ~50 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. SC is required as the typical transit duration for a close planet with 6h<Porb<24h is 15 to 40 min. The transit depth may vary between 25% (Jovian radius) down to 0.2% (Earth radius). Given the high number of transits in a ~90 days observation, K2 should be able to measure objects with a radius smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, PEPSI@LBT (which is starting to work this year) and EXPRESSO@VLT (available in 2 years from now) will be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.
The secondary goal of this proposal is to detect photometric variations due to reflection effects by a faint stellar companion, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting. Kepler has already given an important contribution to this field. K2 can increase by a factor 5 to 10 the statistics of well studied sdB+WD and sdB+M-dwarf systems. We point out that the secondary goal is compatible with LC data."
GO7012,7,Susan,,Benecchi,Planetary Science Institute,susank@psi.edu,"Schwamb, Megan E; Binzel, Richard P.; Lisse, Carey M.",The Lightcurve of Pluto Post New Horizons,"Discovered in 1930, Pluto is a unique dwarf planet that has challenged and inspired the minds of many. It is a key object in the third zone out from our Sun and provides important insight to formation and collisional processes that were at work in the original solar nebula. In July 2015 the New Horizons spacecraft (a NASA mission) will encounter this small, dark, icy world and the family of objects that orbit it providing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to directly link our Earth-based view of Pluto with ground truth provided by in situ measurements. However, this encounter will be short-lived compared to other planetary voyages because it is unfeasible to slow the spacecraft down to orbit within the Pluto system; instead this visit will be a flyby. Studies from Earth-based or Earth-orbit facilities prior to and post encounter will provide critical baseline and context information for optimal interpretation of the valuable flyby science data. 

Pluto is known to be a constantly changing world due to the solar energy being received decreasing by ~2% per year on account of its eccentric orbit now carrying it rapidly away from perihelion.  Whats more, the orientation of Pluto's spin axis and the sub-solar latitude (the height of the ""midday Sun"") changes by more than 1 degree per Earth year, bringing 100,000 square kilometers of new surface area into sunlight for the first time in a century (while casting an equal and opposite polar area into a century long arctic winter). These orbit-related effects on the atmosphere and surface of Pluto are on top of the well-known longitudinal variations measurable over the course Plutos 6.387 day rotation. Observations of Pluto one year prior-to and post-flyby will allow us to identify evolving trends in the system which could be missed if we focused on only the flyby dataset. Our ultimate goal is to better understand Pluto, its family of satellites and their evolution since formation. 

We propose to observe the Pluto system, which is on silicon in the selected Campaign 7 K2 field. These observations will take place after New Horizons has completed its flyby and will provide a key baseline of photometric observations that are not available from ground-based observatories because of Pluto's position relative to Sun during the timeframe of this campaign (Oct-Dec 2015).  Pluto is relatively bright, MV~14, but not overly bright, so it is an ideal object for the K2 set-up. The positional uncertainty of Pluto over the observing period is less than a Kepler pixel providing starlike PRFs in a single K2 observation. Therefore, monitoring Pluto, which moves only a few arcminutes per night, requires a target pixel mask over its path on the FOV. Pluto's rotation period is 6.387 days so the collected 30-min integration ""long cadence"" datapoints will provide measurements of nearly 12 full rotations of Pluto and its companions. Likewise, the 3-month baseline also allows us to sample seasonal variations and solar phase angles ranging from 1.7°-0.2° during Campaign 7. The continuous 30-minute sampling interval provides a time resolution not possible from any other observatory. Some complications for interpreting the dataset will result from the large pixel scale, but the high sampling density will allow for disentanglement of the individual Pluto-Charon lightcurves. 
 
This will be the highest resolution Earth-centered dataset of the Pluto system ever collected and will provide critical long time baseline photometry for tying the New Horizons sub-disk photometry to disk integrated observations. This dataset is critical for our continued study of Pluto's evolving surface-atmosphere interaction as it recedes from the Sun and of the influence of Pluto and Charon on each other. It will also provide insight for interpretation of other dwarf planets and Kuiper Belt objects in the third zone of our Solar System."
GO7013,7,George,H,Jacoby,GMTO / Carnegie,jacoby@noao.edu,"De Marco, Orsola",Measuring the Binary Fraction of Planetary Nebula Central Stars,"Until fairly recently, it was believed that every star between 1 and 8 solar masses enters a short (<50,000 yr) planetary nebula (PN) phase between the AGB and white dwarf phases. Over the last decade, this textbook picture of stellar evolution has begun to break down. Considerable evidence now exists to argue that PN formation may require uncommon circumstances (e.g., binary interactions; De Marco 2009).

The principal failings include (1) the number of PNe in galaxies is 5 times too low, (2) PNe should not form in globular clusters, but they do in small numbers, (3) over 80% of PNe are non-spherical yet their progenitor stars have a spherical wind, and (4) the PN luminosity function (PNLF) method for measuring galaxy distances should fail for ellipticals by a factor of 3 in distance. These anomalies can be explained by and large if most PNe are a manifestation of binary interactions rather than a normal phase of stellar evolution. A close-to-home implication is that the Sun will not become a PN (De Marco 2009; Jacoby et al 1997).

We monitored all 6 PN central stars in Keplers original field. From ground-based data, we expect that 1 in 5-6 PN central stars will exhibit variability of sufficient amplitude (0.05 mag) to imply a close companion (Miszalski et al. 2009); none of the Kepler sample was a known variable. With Keplers superior photometric precision, we detected periodic variability in 3 PN central stars and quasi-periodic behavior in a fourth, at amplitudes 10-100 times lower than ground-based data can measure. The nature of all 4 variables is almost certainly a consequence of binary interactions (De Marco et al 2015).

Of the remaining 2 PNe, Kepler was unable to separate the central star from the nebula (i.e., no result) in one case. In the other case (Abell 61), the star didnt vary, but its spherical morphological is compatible with a single star origin and hence, no photometric variation. Consequently, all 5 observed PNe are consistent with binary PN formation.

Even assuming that data from campaigns 0 and 2 will prove useful, our existing sample (12) is too small to constrain the statistics of the low amplitude binaries. Thus, we request Kepler observations of our targets for Campaign 7, which will raise the PN count from ~12 to ~24*. That will bring the Kepler binary central stars search to a statistical level that is comparable to other binary PN central star detection methods (Miszalski et al 2009; Douchin et al 2015).  As with our cycle 3 data from the original Kepler mission, we will follow up photometric variables with radial velocity spectra to validate binary periodicities (see De Marco et al 2015).

In terms of broader impact, resolving the PN formation mechanism can (1) explain the workings of the PNLF and improve our confidence in its results, and (2) change our expectations for the chemical composition of material returned to the ISM and subsequent galactic chemical evolution.

*This is a continuing program from the original Kepler mission, cycle 3 (5 objects), and the K2 Campaign 0 (3 targets, data being analyzed) and Campaign 2 (4 objects). We will significantly improve the statistics of the sample of 12 objects (5+3+4) from previous proposals.  Campaign 7 is critical, as it is the best field for studying PNe with Kepler. It includes 17 targets, including 4 PNe that we recently discovered for this proposal. Several (~5) may be too faint relative to their nebulae, so we expect that Kepler will provide useful data for ~12 new targets from Campaign 7.

They are powerful standard candles for extragalactic and cosmological studies. They are also key tools for stellar astrophysics for exploring connections between pulsation, mass loss, convection and rotation along as tracers of stellar populations and clusters. In the next decade, Cepheids will be employed to measure the Hubble constant to a precision of 1% using JWST, WFIRST and Gaia. Very few Cepheids have been observed by space-based photometric missions so far. But Kepler may change this: Field 7 of the K2 mission will point towards Sagittarius, to the vicinity of the center of the Milky Way, where several Cepheids can be found. We identified 10 stars that fall on silicon and spread along the Cepheid instability strip, covering multiple subtypes of the variable star class. 

Classical Cepheids. 
We found two members, V350 Sgr and ASAS J193435-1921.7. V350 Sgr is a well-known star, one of the few binary Cepheids where the orbits and dynamical masses have been determined for the system. Both stars pulsate in the fundamental mode, with periods of 5.15 and 2.12 days, respectively. With the K2 light curves we will be able to search for period jitter and determine its dependence from the pulsation periods and amplitudes.

Type II Cepheids (BL Her and W Vir stars). 
Type II Cepheids have not been observed from space before the K2 mission. We identified two short-period, so-called BL Her-type stars within the field, V52 and V839 Sgr. Hydrodynamic models suggest that various dynamical phenomena like period doubling and chaos can occur in these stars. Continuous, high-precision light curves are ideally suited to detect chaos in such light curves. Four long-period, W Vir-type stars are located in the field too (V377, V410, V1037 and V1077 Sgr). W Vir stars show more irregularities in their light curves than classical Cepheids. Continuous K2 measurements may tell whether period doubling or other variations are behind these observations. Moreover, if any of these stars pulsate in the first overtone, we will be able to look for the mysterious PX/P1~0.61 mode observed in RR Lyraes and classical Cepheids extend to these stars or not.

Semiregular stars. 
The instability strip of type II Cepheids extends towards the RV Tauri and yellow semiregular stars. These stars have long pulsation periods and often changing light-curve properties. Although the two stars we identified, V1043 and V4061 Sgr, have main periods similar to the length of a K2 campaign, they exhibit variations on shorter timescales (~30-50 days) that can be followed in exquisite  detail.

Technical details
Only two targets are above the saturation limit, V350 Sgr (V~7.5 mag) and V4061 Sgr (V~9.2 mag). We propose all stars to be observed in long cadence mode. The KASC Working Group 7 has been involved in the Kepler mission from the start and has all the necessary skills to reduce the target pixel files and analyze the data."

We will compare the properties of the  light curves to those of other Fermi blazars for which we have approved and proposed K2 observations. Eight and six Fermi blazars will be observable with high precision in K2 Campaigns 6 and 7, respectively.  Our scientific goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in these gamma ray blazars at the time of K2 observations. The three candidate origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) substantial contributions from multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk with multiple thermal emitting regions.  We will correct the light curves for motion of the spacecraft using the method of Vanderberg and Johnson (2014 PASP 126, 948). Then we will use our own software developed for Kepler observations to compute power spectral densities and fit power law slopes to the power spectral densities. Our previous Kepler work has been published (Wehrle et al. 2013 ApJ 773, 89;  Revalski et al. 2014 ApJ 785, 60; Carini and Ryle 2012 ApJ 749, 70).  The proposed research is relevant to the K2 Cycle 2 solicitation because we will carry out an investigation of science targets using the high precision photometry of the K2 mission with the goal of understanding the origin of optical emission in the cores of  active galactic nuclei. We address the NASA Astrophysics goal of understanding the nature of black holes in the Universe."

Our goal is to discover new pulsating variables, as well as eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars with variability produced by rotating spots.  We will use colors and magnitudes listed in the EPIC catalog to select main-sequence stars with Kepler magnitude between approximately 8 and 12.   Our selection of stars in this magnitude range will minimize the number of pixels required, yet the stars will be bright enough for ground-based ground-based follow-up observations including high-resolution spectroscopic observations.

Observations by the Kepler spacecraft have turned out to be ideal for discovery and characterization of pulsations of main-sequence stars that pulsate in radial and non-radial pressure and gravity modes.  The long time series and high precision of the photometry have enabled determining the frequencies and amplitudes of the modes with periods of order a day (g modes) to a few hours (p and mixed modes) using long-cadence data (30-min integrations per data point).    Analysis of the Kepler data has raised a number of questions about the possible pulsation driving mechanisms for gamma Doradus g-mode and delta Scuti p-mode pulsations, and revealed a surprising number of hybrid star candidates that show pulsations in both types of modes.  The Kepler data has also been used to study slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars (g-mode pulsators), beta Cephei stars (p-mode pulsators) and their hybrids to test stellar pulsation theory in the presumably simpler case for these hotter stars with smaller envelope convection zones.  The analysis has also identified a number of apparently non-pulsating stars that lie within the pulsation instability regions established by theory that need to be explained.  We expect to increase the numbers of these types of stars available for detailed study, especially for candidates brighter than those found in the original Kepler field.   We also expect to discover additional eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars.  

Our sample selection will not be biased toward known pulsators, and will include enough stars to derive statistics of the occurrence of variability.  We will compare our results with similar surveys of stars in the original Kepler Cygnus-Lyra field, and with surveys of stars in young open clusters for K2 Fields 0-5.   We will also produce a catalog of all of the candidate variables, eclipsing binaries, and magnetically active stars that we find."

evolution models with binary stars","The mass discrepancy problem in binary stars stands for the difference between the stellar component masses inferred from binary dynamics and those obtained from spectral characteristics of stars and evolutionary models. The problem clearly points to some missing physical ingredients in stellar structure and evolution theory, and is often solved by introducing an additional near core mixing into evolutionary models by means of an unusually large core overshoot. Our goal is an independent seismic evaluation of the core overshoot parameter for pulsating binary components. 
Binary stars provide a valuable test of the tidal evolution theory. This theory, in particular, describes the evolution of eccentric binary orbits into the stage of two stars with synchronized spin rates and residing in a circular orbit. Current theory predicts time-scale of spins synchronization to be shorter than the time-scale of the orbit circularization. This often contradicts our observations, thus our goal is to test and, if necessary, refine tidal evolution theory, by considering different types of interactions within a binary system.
The resonant excitation of stars free oscillation modes through dynamical tides within a binary system is a direct result of the above mentioned interactions. These tidally induced oscillations provide a potential of probing deep stellar interiors, but the topic is not well explored observationally. We shall remedy the lack of high-quality photometric data for massive binary stars and detections of their tidally-induced oscillations.
A statistically significant sample of pulsating binaries with precise masses is required to meet our science goals. The current sample consists of about a hundred of binaries and is greatly biased towards short orbital periods (< 10 d). With K2, we aim at observing about 100 members of the class of massive binary stars, which will lead to significant extension of the sample, in particular towards longer orbital periods.
Our team has all necessary tools and expertise to perform photometric and spectroscopic data reduction and analyses. The pixel data files delivered by the K2 mission will be used to extract the light curves by means of the software available at the host institute of the project PI. We will rely on the data analysis strategy that proved to be very efficient (e.g., Tkachenko et al. 2014, MNRAS, 438, 3093) and comprises of using the methods like Wilson-Devinney and spectral disentangling for the analysis of light curves and stellar spectra, respectively.
The K2 mission is the only available instrument to deliver the required data for our science goal. The high-quality photometric data, coupled with the state-of-the-art modelling tools, will ensure accurate subtraction of the orbital signal from the light curves, and will allow accurate frequency and asteroseismic analyses. Tidally induced pulsations have periods of a few days, so long cadence is sufficient for our targets.
The present team was a part of the MASSIVE consortium applying for the K2 observations during previous campaigns. We used the experience gained from previous campaigns to do a careful selection of the best K2 targets for our aims in the fields of Campaigns 6&7. The total number of targets to be proposed for the observations is estimated to be about 20."
GO7019,7,Peter,I,Papics,Instituut voor Sterrenkunde,Peter.Papics@ster.kuleuven.be,"Briquet, Maryline; Aerts, Conny Clara; De Cat, Peter",Internal Mixing Processes and Angular Momentum Transport in Pulsating B-type Stars on the Main Sequence,"Stellar lifetime is strongly influenced by internal mixing processes, such as core overshooting and rotation. These effects, and their precise dependency on the presence of magnetic fields or their contribution to the transport of angular momentum and chemical species are poorly known. This lack of understanding results in uncertainties on current stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars. Because many studies within modern astrophysics rely on precise predictions of these models, such as chemical enrichment of galaxies, age determination of the Universe, stellar life cycles and their effect on star and planetary system formation, dynamics within stellar clusters, etc., these uncertainties need to be resolved.

Asteroseismology is one of the few tools which allows us to study the interiors of stars by the interpretation of their non-radial oscillations. In the last years the field went through an unprecedented evolution, thanks to the immense growth in observational data and the vast improvements of asteroseismological techniques. While the nominal Kepler mission already implied a revolution in stellar physics of solar-like stars and red giants, similar achievements were not possible for massive OB stars as most of such targets were avoided in the FoV.

The frequency spectra of the pulsating beta Cep and slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are strongly influenced by the mentioned mixing processes (e.g., Miglio et al. 2008, MNRAS, 386, 1487), which makes them ideal asteroseismic probes. By calculating theoretical pulsation models (based on stellar structure models with different input physics) we can confront the observed and theoretical frequencies and put constraints on the parameters which are either missing from, or ill-constrained in current theories. A handful of available detailed analyses show such a variety in the observed variable behaviour (e.g., Degroote et al. 2010, Nature, 464, 259; Papics et al. 2011, A&A, 528, A123; Degroote et al. 2011, A&A, 536, A82; Papics et al. 2012, A&A, 542, A55), that details in the internal physics of these stars must be different. So far, in-depth seismic modelling resulting in the determination of the overshooting parameter was achieved for only one SPB star from Kepler data (Papics et al. 2014, A&A 570, A8), bringing the total number of OB dwarfs for which this value is available to 16 (Aerts et al. 2014, arXiv:1407.6479). 

Although the amount of observational constraints is growing, the number of in-depth investigations providing precise physical parameters, and their coverage of the instability strips is too low to refine theory. K2 can have a significant contribution to extending this sample, and get us closer to the much-needed precise calibration of stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars. Furthermore, the different K2 Fields pointing towards different stellar populations of the Galaxy will show if/how internal processes and parameters depend on the presence of magnetic field, internal rotation, and stellar properties such as metallicity across the instability strips. Our final goal is to give a quantitative seismic estimate of core overshooting and internal rotational mixing using a sample of B-type stars, and obtain improvements from typically 20% to 1% relative precision in the interior physics laws for such stars. This will propagate to the very first seismic  and thus reliable  calibration of stellar evolution models in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.

We propose a few tens of targets for Fields 6 and 7 of the K2 Mission. All targets are well suited for Long Cadence, because the dominant oscillations are in the order of a day. This also explains why ground-based observations are extremely difficult for these targets."
GO7021,7,William,D.,Cochran,The University of Texas at Austin,wdc@astro.as.utexas.edu,"Johnson, Marshall C; Shporer, Avi",Probing the Planetary Population of High-Mass Stars,"Objectives: To date most planet searches have been confined to stars of spectral type F and later, as hotter stars have fewer spectral lines and tend to be rapidly rotating, making radial velocity (RV) observations difficult. By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can help to expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiant stars in this mass range [1], but the actual masses of these subgiants have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus a number of planet candidates which are pending validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement subgiant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets and will be able to probe close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the subgiants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars, which currently number five confirmed planets, too few to allow statistically significant investigations of this population. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2. 

Targets: We plan to request approximately 500 long cadence targets, mostly in Field 7. The sample will consist of A and early F-type dwarfs. We will propose for targets with 8<V<12.5, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: We will process the K2 data and search for planetary transit signals using PyKE. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory; we will leverage our group's experience with similar observations of Kepler prime mission targets. For long-period targets where the K2 observations are insufficient to constrain the transit parameters to the desired precision, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT). Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other techniques. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can even find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (an extension of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to rapidly rotating stars, where the spectral line distortion during transit is spectroscopically resolved) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit. We are currently pursuing a program to validate Kepler prime mission candidates using Doppler tomography [5], and will use the same methodology for K2 candidates.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

GO7022,7,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Edwards, Zachary I",The Close-Binary Fraction of Planetary Nebulae in K2 Field 7,"The common textbook states that any single star, similar to our Sun, will eventually result in a Planetary Nebula (PN).  Recently, however, theory suggests that PNe can only occur from close binary systems (as a preferred method to create the unique, non-spherical morphologies seen in common PNe), indicating that a single star might not create a PN.  This leaves the mass loss mechanism and fate of single stars, much like our Sun, unknown.  Current theory has big uncertainties, and there are competing groups championing the various possibilities.  To test the theories and differentiate between these ideas, we must measure the binary fraction of central stars in PNe.  Over the last decade, large efforts have been made to search for companions of the central white dwarf by all the usual means of spectroscopy (searching for radial velocity variations), imaging (looking for close in companions), and photometry (looking for brightness modulations on the orbital period).  The trouble is that all these methods have low and poorly-known discovery efficiencies.  To date, there is an estimated binary fraction of ~20% (Miszalski et al. 2009).  But the question is whether the binary fraction is really this low, or is it just poor discovery efficiency? 

Kepler can solve this long-running controversy, because it has proven to be very efficient in detecting eclipses, reflection effects, and ellipsoidal variations at millimag accuracy, thus allowing detection of binary systems with periods <10 days.  That is, when looked at with sub-millimag accuracy, nearly all not-long-period binaries will display periodic modulation on the orbital period.  There were five PNe located and period-searched in the original Kepler field (Douchin et al. 2011).  Kepler studies of these PN nuclei found periodic variations in all five of their light curves that indicate binarity.  The periods of the central stars range between 0.17-1.47 days with orbital modulations at the 0.2-10 millimag level.  (Note, such periodic modulation is effectively impossible to discover from the ground.)  Of these five PNe, the faintest central star was at V=18.2 mag in the center of Kn61.  This original study proves that Kepler is highly efficient at binary discovery, and so this appears to be the only way to answer the problem, but only with more than just five PNe.

Only the K2 mission can measure more PNe so as to get the numbers required for a confident answer.  We have proposed for K2 to observe PN nuclei in the various prior Fields, with 3 in Field 0, 4 in Field 2, and 1 in Field 4.  Over the first ten Fields, K2 will amass good statistics to measure the binarity of PN nuclei.  Field 6 has zero useable PNe, while Field 7 has seven good PNe.  These new PNe all have central stars brighter than V=17.4 mag.  So we are proposing to have K2 target the seven PNe in Field 7 with the 30-minute cadence.

RELEVANCE: Only the Kepler spacecraft can discover PN binarity with high efficiency, and only the K2 mission over the first ten fields can collect enough systems to get out of small number statistics.  The increased sample size of PNe from K2 observations will further add to the number of PNe observed by the Kepler spacecraft, thus allowing for tighter constraints to be placed on the actual binary fraction of central stars in PNe and refine the Miszalski et al. (2009) binary fraction.  Our binary fraction will resolve a debate that is central to the evolution of sun-like stars.  As such, our proposed program is very relevant for NASA's goals of better understanding stellar evolution and the fate of our Sun in particular.

These 'superflares' have durations from minutes to days, amplitudes up to 3 mags, and emission from X-ray to radio.  Kepler has made for a revolution in superflares by providing large event numbers on many Sun-like stars (Maehara et al. 2012; Schaefer 2012).  The most popular current model has reconnection of the magnetic fields stretching between the Sun-like star and a nearby planet (Rubenstein & Schaefer 2000; Lanza 2008).  This scenario was explicitly stealing the model for RS CVn superflares.

RS CVn stars are G-type main sequence stars in close orbit (1-14 day orbital periods) around cooler stars, with synchronization speeding up the stellar rotations and hence increasing greatly the magnetic activity of the stars.  BY Dra stars are similar to RS CVns, with a somewhat cooler surface and sometimes apparently single.  RS CVn and BY Dra stars have occasional superflares, with energies up to 10^38 erg, durations from hours to a day, amplitudes up to 1.6 mag, and emission from X-ray to radio.  Models for RS CVn superflares all involve magnetic reconnection with loops stretching between the G-star and the cool star (Simon et al. 1981; Ferreira 1998).  The difference in energy between solar flares and RS CVn superflares is that the loop length could be much longer and the surface field much stronger.  The field configuration, trigger, and detailed microphysics of RS CVn superflares are poorly known (Ferreira 1998).

A small number of RS CVn superflares have been reasonably observed from X-ray to optical to radio.  Nevertheless, there are two glaring gaps in the RS CVn data:  First, the coverage has been much too haphazard and gap-filled, so demographic properties are badly known.  Second, only the largest RS CVn superflares have been detected and reported, leaving it completely unknown as to the existence, frequency, and properties of any low-amplitude events.

We propose to use the K2 mission to monitor RS CVn and BY Dra stars for superflares.  K2 can uniquely solve the two big gaps because the relentless gapless coverage for ~80 days will provide uniform and biasfree flare searches, and because the millimag accuracy allows for the confident detection of superflares with amplitudes over two orders-of-magnitude smaller.  No RS CVn star was targeted in the original Kepler  field or in any K2 fields, other than the 29 RS CVns (with no BY Dra stars) that we proposed for Fields 4 & 5.

We have identified 5 RS CVn stars (in Field 6) and 2 BY Dra stars (in Field 7) brighter than 16th mag that K2fov gives as being on-chip.  For flares found, amplitudes, durations, orbital phases, energy estimates, and light curves would be published, along with demographic results like size-frequency distributions.  The great statistics from K2 will be able to perform tests like measuring the orbital phase dependence of flare frequency so as to distinguish between the magnetic loop and the magnetospheric tail reconnection models.

RELEVANCE:  RS CVn and BY Dra superflares fit into a larger picture of superflares on Sun-like stars, with these other superflares having similar observational properties.  A goal of this K2 proposal is to test how similar are the types of superflares, with this having good relevance for NASA's goal of understanding the biggest solar flares.  Only the K2 mission has the gapless long-term coverage with millimag accuracy as required to spot large and small superflares.

GO7024,7,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,,Short-Duration Flares on Mira Stars,"Mira stars are slowly pulsating red giant stars with periods of order a year, so it came as a startling surprise when they were discovered to have short-duration flares (Schaefer 1991).  These flares were observed with amplitudes 0.4 to 1.4 mag and durations from 3 minutes to 3 hours, and were visible in both the optical and the radio.  Mira flares have been confirmed by Maffei & Tosti (1995), de Laverny et al. (1998), and Stencel et al. (2003), with flare durations lasting up to 6 days.  However, studies by Mais et al. (2004), Wozniak et al. (2004), and Lebzelter (2011) have failed to find any flares on various samples of red giants.  It is currently unclear what subset of Mira stars and what phases show flares, no detailed models have been made, and we have little knowledge of flare demographics.  Models of Mira flares (e.g., Struck et al. 2002) point to magnetic reconnection involving planets orbiting the Mira star.
	
The original Kepler mission did look at 317 M giant stars, but this includes only two classic Mira stars (Banyai et al. 2013).  They do not report any flares, but they only report on Fourier transforms for periods longer than a day, so this study was not sensitive to Mira flares.  Nevertheless, this study provides a proof that Kepler can follow Mira stars with 30-minute time resolution and ~0.1 millimag accuracy.  I have already made successful K2 proposals for 3+30+5+2 Miras in Fields 0, 2, 4, and 5.  (Fields 1 & 3 have no Mira stars.)  I have already reduced the Field 0 light curves, and I find flares at the 0.0005 to 0.0020 mag level.
	
For K2 Fields 6 & 7, I have selected 2 and 49 targets, all confirmed Mira variables.  I selected only those that are always brighter than V=16, to ensure good photometric accuracy, and to avoid biasing against flares near minimum.  All targets are on-chip by K2fov.
	
I propose to have Kepler monitor Mira stars during the K2 mission for Fields 6 & 7, with the 30-minute cadence, with the goal to be to discover flares from a few minutes to days in duration.  (Even with a 3 minute flare, a 0.1 mag amplitude event would be easily detected as a 10 millimag event which should be highly significant.)  The analysis would be to subtract a long-term spline-fit to the light curve, make running box-averages over a wide range of bin-sizes, and seek flares above a 5-sigma significance level (after accounting for the number of trials and bins searched).  This statistical limit will be applicable to fast flares, while flares longer than a day or so will be limited by the accuracy of interpolating the before-and-after light curve.  For flares found, amplitudes, durations, phases, energy estimates, and light curves would be published, along with demographic results like size-frequency distributions.
	
RELEVANCE.    Ground-based light curves are notoriously difficult to find small rare flares, while the Kepler satellite solves this due to having sub-millimag accuracy and a relentless light curve without gaps for many months.  So Kepler is unique at being able to address the many big unknowns regarding Mira flares.  My small K2 program will increase the number of Mira stars monitored by Kepler from 2 (for the original Kepler field) to 93 (with Fields 0-7), and so will make such a big advance that it has the potential for solving many of the questions.  K2 will provide the first accurate and full-coverage light curve for the startling flares on Mira stars, and will give detailed demographic properties, like flare frequency/size/duration as a function of Mira type, period, and phase.

Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system [1-5], colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk [6-7], and studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength which may limit models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration of planetesimals. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies.

Light curves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. These two populations are in stable resonances with Jupiter (Hildas in the 3:2 resonance at 4 AU, Trojans are located at 5 AU in the L4 and L5 Lagrange points of the Sun-Jupiter system) and collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations [8-9]. Results from the WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojan asteroids and ~40% of Hilda asteroids are either extremely elongated objects, or are binaries[10]. Kepler optical light curves are required to confirm these controversial findings. Ground based optical surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability survey. Large amounts of observing time are required, and analysis of lightcurves obtained over a few nights is hampered by aliasing induced by limited photometric sampling over regularly spaced nightly intervals. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform and the correspondence between the Campaign 6 field and the L4 Trojan cloud.

We have identified ~120 objects for study in the Hilda and Trojan asteroid populations to be studied with Kepler in Campaigns 6 & 7 with magnitudes of m_V < 20.  Due to the overlap between the Campaign 6 field and the L4 Trojan cloud, our request for data represents 110 objects Campaign 6 and 10 objects in Campaign 7. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 24 days for our targets. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity to test the results reported by the WISE survey.

GO7026,7,Michael,Thomas,Carini,Western Kentucky University,mike.carini@wku.edu,,Rapid Optical Variability in Infrared and Optically Bright Blazars,"Blazars are extreme examples of the phenomena known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak/absent discrete spectral features leave us with only continuum variability and/or polarization variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. The blazar class of objects is comprised of the BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects and the flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ). The difference between a BL Lac and a FSRQ lies primarily in the strength of any emission lines present in the spectrum. In the BL Lac objects, emission lines are nonexistent or are present with equivalent widths < 5 Å, while in the FSRQ emission lines are present with equivalent widths > 5 Å. Blazar spectral energy distributions display a two-bump structure. At low energies there is a peak arising from synchrotron emission in the jet, while at higher energies the peak is believed to be the result of inverse Compton scattering of photons off of relativistic electrons in the jet. The frequency of the synchrotron peak divides blazars into sub-classes: low frequency peaked (LBL), intermediate frequency peaked (IBL), and high frequency peaked (HBL).

Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F6 and F7 field of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of blazars with Kep magnitude < 17 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip (DAbrusco et al. 2012) that are not previously identified blazars. There will be at most 100 sources in the final proposed sample. The Kepler spacecraft demonstrated the ability to produce unprecedented light curves of AGN during the prime Kepler mission (Mushotzky et al. 2011, Carini & Ryle 2012, Edelson et al. 2013, Wherle et al. 2013). Our initial results from K2 F0 and F1 indicate a better than expected performance from K2 (Carini & Williams, 2015).  The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. These observations will allow the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, which is related to the size of the emitting region in the jet via light travel time arguments. They will also allow the determination of the slope of the power spectral density (PSD) on timescales from minutes to several months and allow searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD that indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales. Finally, the expected sampling and quality of this data set will allow a search for quasi-periodic oscillations on the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to extend the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies. 

The K2 Guest Observer-Cycle 2 solicitation calls for acquisition and analysis of new scientific data utilizing K2s high precision/high cadence photometry capabilities. The proposed observations and subsequent science require such observations and are thus relevant to this solicitation.

The ~80 days of near continuous, high-precision observations will be the first of its kind observations of any RCB star. One RCB star, V1157 Sgr, is expected to be on silicon during Field 7 observations. These potential observations will be several orders of magnitude more precise than the best that can be done from the ground, with a typical cadence of once per day and uncertainties > 0.01 mag. These observations will provide a better understanding of the pulsation mechanisms and modes in RCB stars. They also provide new inputs to stellar pulsation models in order to better determine their masses. RCB stars are thought to be ~0.9 M(Sun) from stellar pulsation models (Saio 2008). This estimated mass agrees well with the predicted mass of the merger products of a CO- and a He-WD (Han 1998). Final-flash stars, since they are single white dwarfs, should typically have masses of 0.55-0.6 M(Sun). No RCB star, with T(eff) = 5000-7000 K, is known to be a binary so these mass estimates are of great importance to understanding the evolution of these enigmatic stars.

RCB stars show periodic or semi-periodic light and radial velocity fluctuations due to both radial and non-radial pulsations. These stars show pulsation periods in the 40-100 d range (Lawson et al. 1990). These variations are separate from the large declines in brightness caused by dust forming around the star. The pulsations in RCB stars are thought to arise through strange-mode instabilities. Strange modes occur in stars with high luminosity where radiation pressure dominates (Saio 2008). 

RCB stars comprise a peculiar and rare class of stars that offers an excellent opportunity to reveal crucial insights into the advanced stages of stellar evolution. The first star of this class, R Coronae Borealis (R CrB), was discovered to be variable over two centuries ago. The known population of RCB stars is now ~150 stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds (MC). RCB stars form a class of cool, carbon-rich supergiants that have almost no hydrogen. They undergo extreme, irregular declines in brightness, of up to 9 magnitudes, due to the formation of thick clouds of carbon dust. Two scenarios have been proposed for the origin of an RCB star: the Double Degenerate (DD) and the final helium-shell flash (FF) models. The former involves the merger of a CO- and a He-WD. In the latter, a star evolving from a planetary nebula (PN) central star expands to supergiant size by a FF. Three stars (Sakurais Object, V605 Aql, and FG Sge) have been observed to undergo FF outbursts.

Most amazingly, in the last decade RCB stars were found to have unique chemical abundances. Clayton et al. (2007) discovered that RCB stars have 16O/18O ratios that are ~500 times lower than the Sun or any known star. Soon after, Pandey et al. (2008) found that 19F was also overabundant. The combination of extreme levels of 18O and 19F, which are both by-products of partial He-burning, suggest that nucleosynthesis must have occurred, but was then interrupted and ultimately quenched during the formation of the RCB stars. Sakurais Object shows no evidence for 18O. On the other hand, Sakurais object and other FF objects are enriched in Lithium (Li). Several RCB stars, including R CrB itself, have significant Li in their atmospheres. The production of 18O and 19F requires temperatures large enough to completely destroy any Li present. Hence, the simultaneous enrichment of Li, 18O, and 19F is not expected in the WD merger or final flash scenarios. The study of the pulsations of RCB stars will be crucial in helping to distinguish between the DD and FF scenarios.

The K2 mission has in a short time proven to be a successful successor to Kepler despite limitations in both pointing and observational duration. As with the original mission, pixels from the entire frame are not generally downloaded due to date rate limitations; instead, only predefined postage stamps surrounding the primary targets are made available. As characterization of the mission has improved, postage stamp sizes have shrunk and are now typically 16 x 16 pixels (approximately 1 arc minute square), with some exceptions such as areas surrounding open clusters or particularly bright targets. Even these small postage stamps generally contain several secondary targets in addition to the primary target.

Pipeline data reduction to produce time series from the postage stamps is not provided by the project, and a small number of groups have therefore solved this problem independently (see, e.g. Vanderburg & Johnson 2014, Buzasi et al. 2015), and many of these plan to make their data available to the community. An important distinction of the PIs pipeline is that we can produce light curves for all of the (well-separated) stellar targets in each field of view. We propose to produce light curves for all of the secondary targets in each K2 field of view, perform planet searches in each of those time series, and release the time series to the community.

Note that we are not requesting specific targets, but will take advantage of the fields requested by others to enable us to examine an unbiased (or less-biased) sample. Given the estimated 10,000 primary targets in each pointing, we conservatively estimate that we will produce light curves for 20,000 secondary targets.

2. Methodology

Our pipeline identifies targets in each field which are well-separated enough for accurate photometry and determines appropriate extraction mask sizes and shapes by minimizing noise at multiple user-selectable frequencies. We then generate time series using aperture photometry, and iteratively detrend the time series against CCD position and background level. As presented in Buzasi et al. (2015), we have found that this procedure produces light curves with noise levels less than twice that of the original mission.
 
We will perform planet searches in the resulting time series using both matched-filter approaches and a citizen science method inspired by the Planet Hunters program (http://www.planethunters.org). In the latter case, a year-long honors program course taught by the PI at Florida Gulf Coast University will visually examine light curves generated by the pipeline, taking advantage of human pattern recognition skills to identify periodic transit-like events. Students will follow up with more detailed analysis to produce planet candidate lists. We anticipate that the citizen science approach will find most of the hot Jupiters in the sample, while the matched-filter approach will be more suited to smaller candidates. Candidate lists and light curves will be publicly released to enable other researchers to verify our findings and perform their own searches, as well as to perform other science such as asteroseismology. We will also work with a local planetarium to produce public outreach products.

3. Relevance

While the K2 mission is a general-user facility and lacks primary science objectives, clearly exoplanet science continues to generate the most excitement connected with the missions, and we will focus our attention on that aspect. However, the light curves we will produce and release will include a wide variety of different kinds of objects, including potentially source types we have not yet seen with either Kepler or K2, and thus will be of the broadest scientific interest and relevance to NASA science objectives. Our educational and public outreach components will further contribute to the significance of the proposed project to NASA."
GO7029,7,Brian,K,Jackson,Boise State University,bjackson@dtm.ciw.edu,"Adams, Elisabeth Rose; Endl, Michael",Looking for Very Short Period Planets with the K2 Mission,"Science Goals and Objectives  From wispy gas giants on the verge of disruption to tiny rocky bodies already falling apart, short period exoplanets pose a severe challenge to theories of planet formation and evolution, but they dominate observational constraints on planetary composition, internal structure, meteorology, and more. For instance, the only rocky exoplanets for which mass estimates can be made (except for the few fortuitous systems that exhibit transit-timing variations) are those in very short period orbits  Kepler-10 b and, recently, Kepler-78 b are two famous examples. Moreover, understanding the origins of very short period planets may elucidate key processes in formation and evolution. Gas disk migration may have brought the objects in from where they formed but would require disks extending to nearly the stellar surfaces, contrary to observations and theoretical expectations that stellar magnetospheres truncate gas disks much farther out. We propose to collect photometric observations of stars that may host very short period planets (with periods d 1 day) using the K2 mission. We will convert the raw K2 images into light curves and search for transits. We will follow up putative transit candidates with spectral and radial velocity observations to continue the already fruitful and exciting search for very short period planets.

Targets  Our proposal will include d 1,000 main-sequence F-K stars, putting our proposal in the small category. We will select objects suitable for spectral observation and possible radial velocity (RV) follow-up and use the online tool provided by K2 to check that all targets fall on K2 silicon (code 2). We request that our targets be observed even if this proposal is not selected for funding.

Methodology  For Task 1, we will generate photometric time series from the raw K2 images, and the Kepler PyKE python package provides the necessary capabilities, based on Vanderburg & Johnson (2014). For Task 2, we will detrend light curves and apply an automated search algorithm (EEBLS  Kovacs et al., 2002) to find transits. We will also perform (to the extent possible) photometric and pixel-level analyses to vet candidate signals. For Task 3, for vetted candidates, we will characterize host stars and collect RV observations using low-precision spectra to rule out binaries and blend scenarios. For available targets, we will collect and analyze precise RVs from the HRS spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory to confirm candidates as planets and estimate their masses. For targets inaccessible from McDonald, we will propose for follow-up observations at a suitable facility, Keck, for example.

Relevance  This proposal will leverage the unique capabilities of the K2 mission to look for an unusual and astrophysically compelling class of planet.

The first of our two objectives is to measure variations in the occurrence rate of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood. We already see differences between the populations of planets orbiting nearby stars and stars in the prime Kepler Field.  For example, hot Jupiters are 2.5 times less abundant in the Kepler Field (Howard et al. 2012).  We have to wonder if the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone (Petigura et al. 2013) is similarly reduced relative to nearby stars. With this proposal we will measure the occurrence of detectable, short-period super-Earths and Neptune-size planets (~2-3 Earth-radii). Our second goal is to discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  This Cycle 2 proposal for the C6 and C7 fields is part of our larger effort covering all K2 fields and is a merger of the Cycle 1 programs by A. Howard/E. Petigura and J. Winn/R. Sanchis-Ojeda.

We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts. request approximately 5000 stars in a magnitude-limited sample with Kp < 13 and approximately 3000 stars with Kp > 13 but excellent planet detectability (mostly late G and K dwarfs).  This Cycle 2 request for Campaigns 6 and 7 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in C0 (R. Sanchis-Ojeda - 3641/7758 selected), C1 (R. Sanchis-Ojeda - 3755/7000 selected), C2 (E. Petigura - 4115/5311 selected), C3 (E. Petigura; 3859/5875 selected), C4 (A. Howard - 5195 proposed; J. Winn - 16,700 proposed), C5 (A. Howard - 4471 proposed; J. Winn - 15,600 proposed) constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.

We are searching for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013). We will compute the occurrence rates of small, close-in planets using injection-and-recovery tests to account for the sensitivity of TERRA and will report the field-to-field variability and overall rates of planet occurrence. Assuming a precision of 80 ppm over 6.5 hours, a 2 Earth-radii planet with P = 20-day will be detectable at SNR = 8 during a single 75-day K2 campaign.  Based on the prime mission occurrence statistics, we expect to find 3.1 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with P < 20 days per 1,000 stars observed. A sample of 5,000 stars is expected to yield ~15 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with orbital periods less than 20 days, providing an occurrence measurement with 25% fractional uncertainty. With 5,000 stars, we will be sensitive to factor-of-two variations in the occurrence rate of 2-3 Earth-radii planets at 4-sigma significance.

In addition, we will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES and other facilities. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultrashort-period Earths. Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission.

This proposal directly addresses two objectives from the prime Kepler mission: measuring planet occurrence rates and characterizing small planets with Doppler mass measurements."

neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that
asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.

RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.

AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (~7000-9000 per campaign) to probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys structure and evolution from its stellar populations.

METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys
targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use our seismic inferred stellar properties to stress-test state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia,
TRILEGAL)."
GO7033,7,Patrick,,Gaulme,New Mexico State University,gaulme@nmsu.edu,"Jackiewicz, Jason",Solar-like Oscillations in Eclipsing-Binary Systems,"We propose to use K2 unique capability to detect solar-like oscillations of main-sequence and red-giant stars that belong to well-known eclipsing binaries. This proposal follows those submitted for K2 fields 0, 1, and 2. In Field O (GO0073), we were awarded one short-cadence and three long-cadence targets. In Fields 1 and 3 (GO1034 & GO3064), our two submitted targets were selected for short-cadence observations (no submitted targets in Field 2). Decisions regarding Fields 4 and 5 are pending. This document is an overview of the proposal that will be submitted by February 27.

Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. As illustrated by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, asteroseismology is an efficient method to measure masses, radii, and ages of large numbers of stars, which is of prime importance to test stellar evolution. However, a crucial test of both asteroseismic masses and radii of a large sample of stars with independent measurements of those quantities has not yet been carried out. Eclipsing binary systems (EBs) potentially permit such an exercise by allowing for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, provided that spectral lines are detectable for both components. EBs are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough (e.g. Gaulme et al. 2014). So far, all the published stars known to both display solar-like oscillations and belong to EBs are red-giants (RGs), and all have been detected by the Kepler mission. The first detection was the 408-day period system KIC 8410637 (Hekker et al. 2010, Frandsen et al. 2013). Since then, Gaulme et al. (2013 & 2014) reported a list of 18 bona fide new RG eclipsing-binary candidates, of which 14 displayed oscillations. More recently, Beck et al. (2014) reported the discovery of 18 new heartbeat stars, where each system has a RG component with oscillations, and three are also EBs. Provided that oscillations are detected, observing known EBs with K2 is a unique opportunity to extend the sample of systems to test asteroseismology.

The purpose of this GO proposal is to observe a small set of eclipsing binaries that are already well characterized in terms of physical parameters (orbits, masses, radii). Doing so present two main advantages. Firstly, observing well-known systems helps predicting the likelihood of detecting solar-like oscillations. Secondly, the objective is to reduce the burden of ground-based follow-up, which is very time-consuming when radial-velocities need to be measured. The target list is obtained by pre-selecting systems from the General Catalog of Variable Stars (GCVS), then by checking the available literature.  A set of eight targets has been identified in K2s fields 6 and 7. 

Funding will be requested to pay a graduate student for a 1-year and two trips to Europe, where most of the asteroseismic conferences/workshops are held.

Long thought to be an asterism, we have recently demonstrated that it is actually the oldest nearby star cluster, with an age of 3 Gyr at a distance of 300 pc (Curtis et al. 2013, AJ, 145, 134). For comparison, the stars in the similarly aged Kepler open cluster NGC 6819 are approximately 70 times fainter, and those in the classic old benchmark M67 are nearly 10 times fainter. This proximity has allowed us to obtain high-resolution spectra for nearly the entire membership, enabling studies of chromospheric activity, lithium depletion, and detailed stellar characterizations; our AO imaging resolves binaries with only 50 AU separations; we can spectroscopically identify and characterize the white dwarfs and red dwarfs; and we can measure coronal X-ray luminosities from Sun-like stars down to the early K dwarfs with Chandra data in-hand.
Ruprecht 147 is located in Sagittarius, and sat just beyond the edge of the proposed field for K2 Campaign 7, until we successfully led a petition for a pointing adjustment to accommodate the cluster. Our proposed K2 survey will provide asteroseismic data for the upper main sequence turnoff and evolved stars. This will yield an independent age constraint for this unique benchmark cluster, based on the stellar masses derived for the red giant branch.
K2 will measure rotation periods for 3 Gyr Sun-like stars. These data are sorely needed for gyrochronology calibration, and will demonstrate the ability of stellar spin down to differentiate between 2.5 Gyr (NGC 6819 Kepler prime), 3 Gyr (R147) and 4 Gyr (M67 campaign 5) ages (Meibom et al. 2015, Nature). R147s proximity allows K2 to provide higher quality data for members of much lower mass than for the distant NGC 6819. Pairing these rotation periods with our chromospheric and coronal X-ray data will provide a comprehensive view of angular momentum and magnetic dynamo evolution at 3 Gyr.
The 8-hour photometric variability signal known as flicker, known to trace stellar density and surface gravity, is also detectable in K2 light curves (Bastien et al. 2013, Nature, 500, 427). We will construct a color-flicker diagram for R147, which will (1) test if K2 flicker measurements properly order the cluster sequence, and therefore produce accurate relative gravities, (2) potentially offer flicker calibration for lower mass stars lacking seismic calibration, and (3) test signal-to-noise dependence, in comparison to a similar color-flicker diagram assembled for M67 from Campaign 5. Calibrating and validating K2 flicker will have broad impact for the entire K2 mission.
Finally, all astrometric-photometric members will be surveyed for stellar and exoplanetary transits. If any low mass eclipsing binaries are discovered, they could become important touchstones because we also know their ages and compositions. K2 is sensitive to 3 Earth radius exoplanets around the early M dwarfs in Ruprecht 147. The transit survey will nicely complement the radial velocity surveys already targeting the cluster."
GO7037,7,Philip,Steven,Muirhead,Boston University,philipm@bu.edu,"West, Andrew A; Skinner, Julie N; Cushing, Michael C; Schneider, Adam",Activity and Planets at the Bottom of the Main-Sequence,"We propose to observe a carefully selected sample of ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs) with K2 during Campaigns 6 and 7.  UCDs occupy the transition from main-sequence stars to brown dwarfs (late-M and later) and are essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the lowest mass objects in the Universe.  Historically, photometric monitoring of UCDs for transiting planets and rotational spot modulation has been hampered by their intrinsic faintness and the expected short duration of transit events.  The K2 spacecraft provides an excellent opportunity to study these objects in more detail, thanks to the large aperture and near-continuous 80-day photometric coverage of each K2 field.

Searching for Transiting Planets Orbiting UCDs: The discovery of a transiting-planet orbiting a UCD would having significant implications for the field of exoplanets.  UCDs are small, all roughly the diameter of Jupiter, which implies deep fractional transit signatures.  UCDs are also relatively bright in the infrared.  A planet that transits a UCD, whether gaseous or rocky, would be an ideal target for near-infrared transit transmission spectroscopy, as has been successfully performed on super Earths orbiting mid-M dwarf stars with the Hubble Space Telescope.  Future transit transmission observations with NASAs James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets, but only for those planets that transit ultra-cool dwarfs.  The transits from rocky planets orbiting mid-M dwarf stars and earlier are simply not deep enough to search for biosignatures over the expected lifetime of JWST.  Recent studies of short-period planet occurrence around early and mid M dwarfs show that lower mass stars have significantly more rocky short-period planets than Sun-like stars. Extrapolating to ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect a large fraction, if not all UCDs to harbor rocky planets with transit probabilities of ~10%.

Spot morphology at the M/L transition: Studies indicate that over 90% of UCDs show evidence of surface activity in the form of H± emission; however, the nature of the activity is not fully understood.  Unlike sun-like stars, UCDs have fully convective interiors and are expected to have magnetic field morphologies markedly different from the Sun.  With precise photometric monitoring of UCDs with K2 we will measure the morphology of spots on the surfaces of UCDs via light curve inversion.  We will also search for flare events and correlate those flare events to specific spots structures.

Surface activity in UCDs is related to stellar wind and ultraviolet emission from their chromospheres, both of which affect the photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets.  Understanding the nature of surface activity on UCDs is therefore critical for interpreting transit-transmission spectroscopy, as well as inferring the habitability of any detected planets.  K2 provides a unique opportunity to study ultra-cool dwarfs in a way never before realized."

Kepler monitored 15 of these systems with results currently published for 8. The detailed coverage enabled unique studies of quiescent orbital and sporadic variability as well as the changes in the disk and stream impact area during short and long dwarf nova outbursts. We propose to monitor a set of CVs in the K2 fields of Campaigns 6 and 7. The Cycle 2 fields represent the extremes of stellar densities with the directions toward the pole and Galactic center. We have matched the K2 fields with several CV databases and expect a total of about 12 targets will be requested in this cycle. These data will extend the range of CV types studied with Kepler's unprecedented continuous, fast-candence observations."

sequence dwarfs and sub-giants, for asteroseismic observations in K2 Fields 6 and 7. These stars are predicted to show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes. Short cadence data are therefore a pre-requisite for detecting the oscillations. Our list comprises stars that will be prime targets for one of the main goals of K2, the detection of exoplanets around bright solar-type stars, for which precise RV follow-up will be possible. We seek to take advantage of the opportunity to have Kepler observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed in the nominal Mission. Because the targets are brighter, much more accurate and detailed prior constraints (e.g., from parallaxes, detailed spectroscopy, interferometry, etc.) will be available on these stars than was usually the case for asteroseismic targets in the original field. It will therefore be possible to bring the full potential of asteroseismology to bear to test the physics of stellar interiors. It will also be possible to go beyond studying stellar structure, to put constraints on the evolution of the solar neighbourhood. These solar-type targets in Field 6 and 7, along with the targets from previous and future fields, will allow us to constrain the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars in a manner that has not been possible before. Note that asteroseismic data can constrain stellar ages much better than any other method. By providing asteroseismic ages of stars with detectable surface rotation periods we will also provide additional calibrators for gyrochonology. And of course, asteroseismology will allow us to better characterize targets that have detected exoplanets, including any new detections made by K2 and also already-known hosts that are on our list."

They provide fundamental stellar parameters (masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities) for objects across the H-R diagram. The K2 mission will probe fields along the ecliptic, thus allowing us to study inherently different stellar populations and their distributions as a function of galactic latitude. Campaigns 6 and 7 focus on the most diverse populations, namely in the direction of the north galactic cap and the galactic center, including NGC 6717, a globular cluster in Sagittarius. Because stars in clusters are coeval, share a common evolutionary path and feature the same chemical abundances, eclipsing binaries found in clusters serve as distance calibrators and stellar population gauges. We collected all known eclipsing binary stars in fields 6 and 7 from available online catalogs (via Simbad and VizieR services), and performed a thorough search for binaries in the proprietary Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT) and SuperWASP survey data to assemble a list of proposed targets for this solicitation. The reduction and analysis will be done by experienced members of the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Working Group."
GO7041,7,Ming,,Zhao,Penn State University,mingzhao@psu.edu,"Wright, Jason T; Beatty, Thomas G; Bastien, Fabienne Anne; Curtis, Jason Lee",K2 monitoring of known transiting planet phase curves and bright planet hosts,"We propose K2 monitoring of known, nearby transiting planet phase curves and characterization of known planet hosts in the Campaign 6 & 7 fields. Nearby known planets are all orbiting bright stars (V<13) and have Radial Velocity (RV) measurements.  Continuous K2 monitoring of these rare but important targets will provide invaluable data for detailed high precision characterization of both the planets and their host stars. Previous K2 campaigns, unfortunately, have missed most, if not all, of these nearby bright and known planetary systems (e.g., WASP-17, WASP-47, WASP-75, GJ 876, etc., to name a few).  We therefore propose and urge Campaigns 6 & 7 to include these systems.

In particular, Campaigns 6 & 7 will have better pointing than previous ones, and Campaign 6 will cover a high galactic latitude, providing the highest available photometry quality in K2. Our main science goals are: 1. to measure the optical phase curves and albedos of available known transiting hot Jupiters, study their atmospheric dynamics in the case where infra-red phase curves are (or will be) available, and compare with other hot Jupiters as an ensemble; 2. to measure the optical secondary eclipses of these hot Jupiters and constrain their orbital eccentricity with existing RV data to study their dynamical history; 3. to look for possible transits of known RV planets in these two fields; and 4. to characterize the stellar properties (rotation, activity) of known planet hosts and long-term RV targets to better understand the stars, their planets, and aid the search of additional planets in these systems. 

We propose ~10 known planetary systems and long-term California Planet Search (CPS) RV targets in Campaigns 6 & 7, including four transiting planets. We require short cadence data for the known transiting planets in order to constrain the ingress and egress timing of their transits and eclipses to precisely measure their eccentricity. We only need long cadence data for the rest of the RV systems. We will implement the detrending and calibration methodology developed by Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) and combine it with our own algorithms to extract the raw K2 light curves. Our transiting planet host stars are in the magnitude range of 11 to 13 mag in the visible, falling in the sweet spot of the demonstrated K2 precision of 30 - 40 ppm per 6-hour integration (Vanderburg & Johnson 2014),  sufficient to measure the optical phase curves and secondary eclipses of these best hot Jupiters with high significance when combining the 75-day data together. 

Our science goals are directly related to exoplanet detection, characterization and stellar astrophysics, all of which are the main areas of the K2 GO program and NASAs exoplanet exploration program. These observations cannot be replicated from the ground due to the requirement of continuous monitoring and very high precision for optical phase curves. Particularly, the optical phase curves will be rare and valuable datasets for exoplanet characterization before the era of TESS."
GO7042,7,Douglas,Russell,Gies,Georgia State University,gies@chara.gsu.edu,,A K2 Survey of Hot Massive Stars during Campaign C7,"Introduction:
The NASA Kepler mission was a huge success for exoplanet detection and stellar astronomy.  We obtained magnificent time series data that have led to remarkable new studies especially in the areas of asteroseismology, stellar rotational modulation, and binary and multiple stars.  However, the Kepler FOV was selected away from the Galactic plane to avoid problems with blending in the crowded star fields close to the plane.  Because the massive stars are generally young and form in the Galactic plane, the selection of a FOV away from the plane meant that very few massive stars were measured by Kepler (no O-type stars, for example).  Now with K2 we have the opportunity to remedy the situation and follow the light curves of a significant sample of massive stars.  First observations occurred during campaigns C0 and C4, and now in C7, the K2  FOV is again located close to the galactic plane, so that massive star targets are accessible.   This proposal describes the massive star sample and the kinds of scientific investigations that would be possible through such K2 photometric observations.

Sample:
I selected stars from the catalog Photometry and Spectroscopy for Luminous Stars (Reed 2005, AJ, 130, 1652) that is available from CDS Vizier.  A total of 21 targets were selected that are within the nominal boresight coordinates for C7 (RA (J2000) = 19h 11m 19s, Dec (J2000) = -23o 21' 36"") and confirmed to fall on the CCD detectors using the K2fov program.  These stars have magnitudes in the range V = 6 to 12.  They comprise a diverse collection of young stars, mainly of spectral types O and B and spanning all luminosity classes.  The group includes a number of the rapidly rotating Be stars that eject gas into a circumstellar disk.   All these stars are ideal long cadence targets for continuous temporal coverage during the C7 campaign, and we plan to obtain contemporaneous spectroscopy of them.

Eclipsing Binaries:
Massive stars are rare, and consequently there are relatively few with well-established masses from combined spectroscopic and photometric analysis (Torres et al. 2010, A&ARv, 18, 67 note only four eclipsing systems containing O-type stars in their compendium of accurate eclipsing binary results).   Consequently, the identification of new eclipsing binaries would offer us important new targets for the determination of fundamental parameters.  In addition, massive stars are ofter found in multiple systems, and the survey would help determine the incidence of massive stars with eclipsing binary companions.   The duration of C7 would be ideal to discover most of the eclipsing binaries. 

Magnetic Fields and Rotational Modulation:
Massive stars generally have convective cores and radiative envelopes that are not usually associated with magnetic dynamos and field generation.  Nevertheless, sensitive polarimetric surveys like the MiMeS project have led to the detection of magnetic fields in about 10% of the OB-stars.  In these cases, the magnetic field can produce spots that introduce a rotational modulation in the light curve.  The K2 survey will help determine the frequency of such rotational modulations and will provide a sample large enough to study the kinds of stellar parameters that are associated with magnetic fields.

Asteroseismology:
The early-type pulsating stars include the beta Cep class (p-mode), slowly pulsating B stars (g-mode), and periodically variable B- and A-type supergiants.   These pulsations are important probes of stellar interiors.  The K2 sample will determine the incidence of pulsations and how multiple-mode beating may play a role in the gas ejection processes in Be stars."
GO7043,7,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,"Jao, Wei-Chun","A search for exoplanets and close stellar/substellar companions in the local
halo population for K2 campaigns 6-7","We propose to expand the scope of the original Kepler mission by conducting a systematic search for exoplanets orbiting the very old stars of the Galactic halo, a population of stars that was not targeted to any significant degree in the original Kepler mission. Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is know about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. However, our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed in campaigns 6-7 of the Kepler K2 mission identifies 2,709 high-velocity subdwarfs that are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, to identify and characterize the first generation of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will be complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."
GO7045,7,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",A Search for Transiting Objects Orbiting White Dwarf Stars,"Science Goals and Objectives: Given their small size, white dwarf stars present a very intriguing sample to monitor for transiting objects.  Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013).  The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations.  The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]).  Given the extreme difficulty of measuring atmospheric properties of Earth-sized planets around solar-like stars, our first biomarker characterization of an Earth-sized planetary atmosphere, may come from an object transiting a white dwarf star.  Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015).  I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours.  Even if no planets are detected for a significant sample of white dwarfs, an interesting constraint can be put on the population of such planets.

Estimate of the Number of Targets:  Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). 

Methodology:  Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total.  The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits.  Additionally, the first planets detected were around a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992), so it may also be possible for white dwarfs to host planets.  Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign.  Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence.  Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground.  While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation.  However, a follow-up campaign on known targets is quite straightforward.  At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope.  However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation:  A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates.  This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO7046,7,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",Monitoring Targets Within 100 Light Years,"Science Goals and Objectives: Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 light years provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres.  A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets.  It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come.  I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 light years or 30.7 pc.  A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons.  This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes.  This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques.  Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars.  While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges.  A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns).  This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars).  In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored.  The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets.

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability.  An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003).  One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium.  This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint.  Long cadence observations would be appropriate. 

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found.  These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation.  This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO7047,7,Mike,D,Reed,Missouri State University,mikereed@missouristate.edu,"Baran, Andrzej S; Telting, John; Jeffery, Christopher Simon; Ostensen, Roy H.",K2 Observations of Pulsating Subdwarf B Stars in Fields 6 and 7.,"We propose to explore core structure of horizontal branch stars by applying asteroseismological tools to Kepler data of extreme horizontal branch (spectral class subdwarf B) stars. Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars which happen to pulsate, and that allows us to probe their structure. From Kepler's main mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes to constrain structure models from period spacings and frequency multiplets. 
        Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age- some stars show substantial mode trapping while in others it is almost completely absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of differnet evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models.
        Frequency multiplets also tell us rotation periods and orientation of the pulsation axis. From this information we have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary period down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components.
        We made significant progress from the original Kepler mission. However, to fully exploit those advances, we need to complete the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). It would also be a huge benefit to have more examples of pulsators in binaries, as that allows us to more fully explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection.
        To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of a selection of likely sdB pulsators and long-cadence (LC) observations of remaining sdB stars. The SC data can fully explore pulsations and short-period (1 day) binaries and while the LC data can detect some pulsations while still exploring binary sdB stars, especially the longer-period ones.
        Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.
        We will be proposing for about five stars for Campaign 6 and eight for Campaign 7. While none of these are known to pulsate, we only apply for the most promising targets, both in terms of pulsations and interesting binary properties.
        We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include graduate and undergraduate students as signficant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training."

The small size of a white dwarf (WD) star (approximately 1 Earth radii) implies that any sub-stellar or gas giant companion at suitable orbital inclination will completely eclipse it, while terrestrial bodies smaller than the Moon, including asteroids, will still produce transits that are detectable in high signal/noise light-curves.

Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approximately 25% at circa 1Gyr, Zuckerman et al. 2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.

The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically signicant (500 to 1000) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a signicant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).

A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al. (2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al. (2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD? 

This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery. 

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm (5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 11 and 1 (campaigns 6 and 7 respectively) spectroscopically identified WDs brighter than Kepler Magnitude of approximately 19.0 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues to be observed at LC by Kepler 2 in Fields 6 and 7."
GO7055,7,Barry,,Smalley,Keele University,b.smalley@keele.ac.uk,"Holdsworth, Daniel L; Ripepi, Vincenzo; Murphy, Simon James; Catanzaro, Gianni","The Am stars: peculiarities, pulsations and planets","The metallic-line (Am) stars are a sub-class of A-type stars which exhibit strong lines of transition elements and weakening of Ca and Sc lines compared to the strength of the Balmer lines. The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars needs to be rotating more slowly than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 210 days.

The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. Many, but not all, Am stars therefore do pulsate, generally with lower amplitude than normal abundance delta Scuti stars. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars.

Currently there are only two A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33 and Kepler-13A). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars.

Using Kepler and K2, we have begun a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to:
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion,
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binary within the Am stars,
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars.

Only 11 Am stars were observed during the Kepler mission. So far with K2 a further 29 stars have been observed during K2 Campaigns 0 to 3. For this proposal we have 7 targets in Campaign 6 and 17 targets in Campaign 7 for observation in Long Cadence mode. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to well over of 50.
 
The proposal team are experienced in the reduction of Kepler data using PyKE tools and in the analysis of time-varying photometry. We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary.

The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."

OC stars are chemically homogeneous and their distances and ages can be measured with much higher precision than for field stars. Many observables, such as stellar rotation or activity, can be calibrated as a function of spectral type within a cluster, and as a function of age and metallicity using stars from several OCs. For all these reasons, OC stars are ideal targets for exoplanet search. Better than field stars, OC stars allow us to study the dependence of planet frequency as a function of metallicity, age, and environment.
Ruprecht 147 (Rup147) is an old (3 Gyr), nearby (200 pc) OC with super-solar metallicity ([Fe/H]~0.1). This OC has been recently re-discovered by Curtis et al. (2012). Because of its old age (which implies a minimal activity for its main sequence stars), its closeness (members are bright stars), and high metal content (possible higher probability for its stars to host planets), Rup147 is a quite an interesting object for the search of exoplanets in OCs. Indeed, we are already monitoring it with ESO/HARPS (13 nights allocated between 2013 and 2014; additional 8 nights scheduled for late spring 2015). 
Rup147 also is an appropriate target for transit search.
Here, we propose to exploit K2 long term and continuous photometric monitoring capabilities in order to:
- Search for transiting exoplanets;
- Collect simultaneous radial velocities (RV) with HARPS and photometric observations (K2) to estimate and correct for activity effects the RV curves, such as the presence of transitory flares or RV variations induced by stellar rotation. The proposed observations will allow us to prioritize the most suitable targets and select additional candidates for the RV survey, also on the basis of their photometric stability (less active stars).
- Measure rotation periods. Rotation periods measured for single-age populations are critical for investigating how stellar angular momentum evolves over time, how that evolution depends on mass, and how rotation influences the stellar dynamo and the magnetically heated chromosphere and corona. Until now, gyrochronology characterization has only involved stars in young (<1 Gyr) OC. K2 observations of Rup147 will allow us to extend this field to intermediate-age stars.
- Identify and photometrically characterize detached eclipsing binaries (dEBs). With photometry and accurate RV follow-ups it will be possible to estimate masses and radii of the individual stellar components to accuracy better that 1%, as demonstrated in Brogaard et al. (2011,2012). The location of these stars in the mass-radius plane will allow us to estimate the age and the Helium mass fraction (Y) with unprecedented accuracy. The advantage of comparing theory with observation on the mass-radius plane rather than on the traditional color-magnitude diagram (CMD) is huge. The comparison between masses and radii directly with models avoids the effects of uncertainties in distance, reddening and on the color-temperature- metallicity relations, as well as the degeneracy between ages and Y.
Our group has a huge experience on high precision stellar photometry (Piotto et al. 2013, 2015; Bedin et al. 2013, 2015) and astrometry (Bellini et al. 2009, 2010, Libralato et al. 2014), exoplanet characterization (Nascimbeni et al. 2011ab, 2013; Granata et al. 2014), and multi-year wide field surveys for search and characterization of variable stars in OCs (Nardiello et al. 2015). K2 data of Rup147 will be reduced with an independent software we have developed building up from our experience (e.g. Anderson and Bedin 2010) and alternative to Vanderburg et al. (2013) (and similar) techniques. 
We have a list of 250 Rup147 members, down to V=16 that we propose to observe with K2. The detrended light curves will be released to the community."

Looking for planetary systems around young stars with Kepler is a compelling approach to provide constraints on the migration mechanisms and their timescales (Lloyd et al. 2013, arXiv, 1309.1520). In particular, for hot Jupiters, it would allow discriminating between migration during formation within the protoplanetary disk (e.g. Alibert et al. 2004, A&A, 417, 25) and migration through tidal interactions (e.g. Rasio & Ford 1996, Science, 274, 954) that occur on much longer timescales (>500 Myr). For our targets, K2 will provide unprecedented access to the innermost orbital regions around these stars, allowing the identification of small planet candidates within 0.3 AU. The direct imaging follow-up at high-contrast and high-angular resolution with VLT/SPHERE will not only decrease the probability of astrophysical false-positives by background objects to extremely low levels, but it will also complete the picture of these systems in the 5-50 AU range thanks to its unique sensitivity to young giant planets. In addition, some of our targets are also part of a long-term, high-precision radial velocity monitoring with HARPS at the ESO 3.6 m telescope in La Silla, which will allow bridging the gap between the K2 and SPHERE observations.

Any joint detection of a planetary system with K2 and SPHERE would be a major discovery and constitute a ""Rosetta stone"" system for the study and understanding of migration processes and interactions in planetary systems. This is a central question for systems with giant planets at wide orbital separation, for which the far out location could be the result of migration through gravitational interactions with other planets in the system.

Finally, the youngest of our stars can present a significant variability and spots that can challenge the detection of transit signals. To improve our sensitivity to small planets, we propose to observe our targets younged than 250 Myr in short-cadence, which will enable a better filtering of the activity during the processing of the data. In addition, this will allow using asteroseismology to determine the stellar properties down to a few percent, providing an even better understanding of these interesting young stars.

In summary, we want to look for young planetary systems using two powerful exoplanet-hunting instruments, K2 and VLT/SPHERE. We propose to observe 8 stars with ages <600~Myr that will fall into the K2 Fields #6 and #7. All but one have late spectral types and a Kepler magnitude Kp<10. We propose to obtain short-cadence data for 5 of them to use asteroseismology to constraint the physical properties of these young star and to increase our sensitivity to small planets."

Many sdBs are known to have close companions with periods
ranging from 0.05 to 10 days, and must have evolved through the common-envelope-ejection (CEE) process. The closest systems are quite easy to study from the ground, but Kepler observations have opened the door for precise studies of the population of systems with periods between
0.5 and and 10 days.

Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission. The excellent Kepler light curves show photometric signals from Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal deformations and mutual irradiation effects. Long-cadence K2 observations presents us with an unique opportunity to accumulate a larger sample of post-common envelope sdB binaries that can shed light on the statistics of the CEE process, and thereby constrain the long sought after efficiency parameters that govern the common envelope stage of evolution. In the process we hope to find new particularly interesting binary systems, such as the eclipsing cases and those with extraordinary masses that could be progenitors of type-Ia supernovae."

Thanks to its fast photometric cadence, continuous monitoring and high photometric accuracy, Kepler has provided unprecedented insights into various types of compact binaries, and holds an enormous potential for other astrophysical domains on top of planet hunting. Some of the most notable studies have revealed i) the mass ratio and precise orbital parameters through Doppler beaming and Romer delays for compact binaries (Bloemen et al. 2011, MNRAS,410, 178, Bloemen et al. 2012, MNRAS, 422, 2600), ii) the discovery of the rms-flux relation in the aperiodic flickering of accreting white dwarfs (WD, Scaringi et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 2854) iii) stringent tests to the disk instability model through the precise characterization of dwarf nova (DN) outburst cycles and (Cannizzo et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 117) iv) the application of the fluctuating accretion disk model employed on aperiodic variability of X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei to accreting white dwarfs (Scaringi 2014, MNRAS, 438, 1233). Here we propose to continue exploiting the capabilities of SC Kepler data through the use of K2, and specifically ask to observe 1 targets in Field 6 and 4 targets in Field 7 all short cadence mode.

All targets have been selected from the Ritter & Kolb cataloge (A&A, 404, 301). We will probe for all their broad-band variability properties. Together with similar targets observed during the previous K2 campaigns, this will form the most comprehensive study of optical aperiodic variability in accreting compact objects. The results will be compared to the X-ray variability observed in X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei to test the current accretion disk models.

Here a brief description of each one:

HS Vir, Field 6: Cataclysmic variable of the Dwarf nova type with an orbital period of 1.84 hours, also displaying positive superhumps. 

V1082 Sgr, Field 7: Nova-like cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 20.8 hours. This will be the longest period nova-like observed with Kepler.

V4743 Sgr, Field 7: Intermediate polar cataclysmic variable also studied at X-ray wavelengths (Ness et al., 2003, AJ, 594, L127), with an orbital and spin period of 6.7 hours and 23.6 minutes respectivley.

V729 Sgr, Field 7: Dwarf nova cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 4.6 hours.

HETE J1900.1-2455, Field 7: Low mass X-ray binary contain a pulsar (spin period of 377 Hz) with an orbital period of 83.3 minutes. This will be the first of its kind observed with Kepler.

Additional targets might be added from searching the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) or the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) if found to be on silicon and if their magnitudes are found to be suitable (Km<16) for aperiodic variability studies."
GO7060,7,Aleks,,Scholz,University of St Andrews,as110@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Stelzer, Beate; Matt, Sean P","Rotation of M dwarfs: spindown, activity, and gyrochronology","Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter for the evolution of stars and planets. Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy.

Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012).  For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission.

The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars.

Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem.

Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013).

Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. A subsample of ~300 (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields 0 to 9 from 2014 to 2016. For fields 6 and 7, observed in 2015, we propose to include ~100 targets in the K2 fields for these campaigns for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them  will fall onto the Kepler chips. For the subsequent fields we will submit similarly sized numbers of objects. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner in the context of a PhD project supervised by all three co-investigators."

The majority of these observations were done with the CoRoT mission and only few have been monitored in Campaign 0 (C0) of the K2 mission. These data show a high variety of variability, much more diverse than anticipated. We aim to obtain a thorough understanding of this variability by increasing the sample with K2 data of higher quality than the C0 data.

Magnetic massive Bp stars have a magnetic field frozen into the star after the star formation process initiated within the original molecular cloud. The field is aligned according to simple geometric configurations, most often a dipole configuration (e.g.  Neiner et al. 2012,A&A,537,A138). The magnetic field can influence the stellar oscillations (e.g.  magnetic mode splitting; Aerts et al. 2010 for a monograph on asteroseismology) and internal properties (e.g. inhibit mixing; Briquet et al. 2012,MNRAS,427,483). When information on the magnetic field and the seismic properties are combined, strong constraints can be made on the stellar modelling, providing detailed information about the physical processes in the stellar interior. We aim to increase drastically the sample of Bp stars for which such modelling can be performed.

Classical Be stars are fast rotating massive stars which show emission in at least one Balmer line (Collins 987,IAUC,92,3). A circumstellar disk, which is fed by material of the star during periodic outbursts, is responsible for this emission. The reason of the outbursts is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to be related to the fast rotation combined with the stellar oscillations, since all Be stars pulsate. These pulsations can either be caused by the º-mechanism, giving rise to ² Cep or SPB type pulsators, or by stochastic excitation which are further enhanced by the rapid stellar rotation (Neiner et al. 2012,A&A,546, A47). Considering the latter type of pulsations Neiner et al. (2013, ASPC,479,319) concluded that gravito-inertial modes could be playing a key-role in the formation of the circumstellar disks of Be stars by angular momentum transport. We intend to test this scenario, as well as to study the internal properties of the Be stars, from a large K2 sample.

Our last group of proposed targets are the very massive (evolved) OB-type stars. Less than a dozen of these targets were ever observed with photometry from space. Five unevolved O stars were measured with CoRoT (e.g. Briquet et al. 2011, A&A,527,A112). The stellar structure and evolution of OB supergiants remains largely uncertain. We have analysed the five O stars observed in C0 of K2 (Buysschaert et al., in preparation) and found one pulsator and several rotationally modulated stars, but the data quality is too limited and too short in time to perform detailed seismic modelling. A similar conclusion holds for the monitored supergiant candidates. We therefore propose to embark upon new investigations of O-type dwarfs and OB supergiants.

The photometric accuracy and the high duty-cycle of K2 makes the mission best suited to reach our science goals. State-of-the-art modelling tools will be used to translate the seismic information to detailed stellar models. It is expected that none of these massive stars show photometric variations on very short timescales, therefore observations in long-cadence are sufficient.

For the majority of the classical Be stars, spectra are already provided by the BeSS database (Neiner et al. 2011,AJ,142,149). Spectropolarimetric observations will be obtained with ESPaDOnS, HARPSpol or Narval. Our team members already worked together under the MASSIVE consortium and the gathered expertise will be optimal to assess the feasibility of the targets in the proposed Fields 6 and 7.  Around 30 targets were selected in for our study of classical Be stars, magnetic Bp stars and OB-type stars, combined over both fields."
GO7063,7,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Xue, Zhichao",Testing DA White Dwarf Variability: Can They Be Standard Stars?,"Supernova cosmology is a vast and important enterprise, with extensive upcoming ground-based and space-based photometry of supernova light curves, so as to provide the primary measure of Dark Energy. The dominant source of error is now the photometric uncertainty in calibrating the supernova light curves. To advance, better calibrations are needed.  The goal is to get calibrations better than 1%, and hopefully much better than 1%, as such is needed to measure the Dark Energy parameters to the needed precision. The best way to get better standards is to use DA white dwarfs (WDs) in each field as primary standards. With this, only differential photometry is used and the standards will be on-chip with all individual images. As such, substantial effort is being made worldwide to learn to calibrate the DA WDs. A further advantage of DA WDs is that they should be extremely stable standard stars (provided that they are not in close binaries and are not near the ZZ Cet instability strip).

A critical question for this large enterprise is whether DA WDs really are stable?  To be useful for the Dark Energy problem, they have to be nearly all with variability of less than something like 0.1%.  Answering this question is essentially impossible by prior methods.  For example, ground-based methods do not have real accuracy for single measures better than 1% or so (Landolt 2009), and multiple observations have problems with stability.  Even HST cannot be used to provide meaningful tests because the available dwell time on any WD will be too small to detect many types of variability.  The Kepler spacecraft uniquely can answer the question of the amplitude of DA WD variability, because only Kepler has millimag accuracy, awesome stability, and a relentless observing cadence with no gaps for long time spans.

The original Kepler mission observed 11 non-binary DA WDs, all far from the instability strip (Østensen et al. 2011).  These were examined for periodic pulsations, but not for measuring the amplitude of their intrinsic variability.  We have analyzed the 11 light curves from the original Kepler field, correcting for systematic variations and for the usual scatter from Poisson noise.  (We have previously proposed for 6 DA WDs in K2 Fields 4 & 5, but results are not available for these.)  We found that 8 out of 11 stars had intrinsic variations at below the 0.2% level.  But we found the remaining 3 stars to have variations with amplitudes of 0.35%, 0.5%, and 1%, all varying on timescales from half-a-day to 5 days.  This is daunting, because nearly 30% of the DA WDs are too variable to be used for supernova cosmology.  But this result is small-number statistics, and many more systems are needed before anyone can rest the full weight of supernova cosmology and Dark Energy parameters on the DA WDs.

We have selected 4 targets in Field 6 and 1 target in Field 7, as based on the following criteria:  (1) Each must be a spectroscopically confirmed DA WD.  (2) Each must be apparently single and away from the instability strip.  (3) Each must be brighter than 16th mag so that the Poisson noise will be low enough to allow detection of low-amplitude variations even over single time bins.  (4) Each must be definitely on-chip as reported by the K2fov program.

RELEVANCE: One of NASA's top priorities is the measure of Dark Energy, while the supernova cosmology programs desperately need <1% accuracy in their calibration.  DA WDs are currently the best prospects, but it is unknown whether these stars are stable enough.  Only Kepler can measure such variability, and from the original field it looks like ~30% are too variable to use. The increased sample size of  DA WDs from K2 observations will further add to the number of DA WDs observed by the Kepler spacecraft, thus allowing for tighter constraints to be placed on whether they can be standards or not.

All stars in this survey have HATSouth light curves with periodic box-shaped transit signals that have been marginally detected with 5.5 < S/N < 10.0, and with shapes, durations, and other properties consistent with being planetary transits. The signals were considered too marginal for the targets to be selected as HATSouth planet candidates, as each candidate has a high chance of being a false alarm, but the probability that any given star in this sample has a short period transiting planet is significantly higher than for stars chosen at random from the field. The transit signals found in the light curves for these stars have orbital periods ranging from 0.5 to 20 days, transit depths between 1.5 mmag and 68 mmag (around K and M dwarf stars), and Sloan r magnitudes between 8.2 and 16.0. The transit signals, if present, would easily be confirmed by K2.

We are requesting long-cadence K2 observations for all of these stars, which we will reduce to trend-filtered light curves using our existing pipeline and serve to the public through our HATSouth light curve server. We will combine these light curves with the existing HATSouth data and search the combined data for transit signals. Lists of candidate planets will also be made public. New candidates identified based on the K2 data will be entered into our HATSouth follow-up program to confirm planets and determine their properties.

This proposal is relevant to the NASA goal of finding and characterizing exoplanetary systems."
GO7065,7,Wei-Chun,,Jao,Georgia State University,jao@chara.gsu.edu,"Henry, Todd J.",Monitoring the Closest Stars in K2 Fields 6 and 7,"The fundamentals of stellar astronomy are built upon studies of nearby stars. Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution. In addition, a detailed understanding of their physical properties (temperatures, radii, masses, etc.) is essential to the effects that stellar hosts have on any exoplanets orbiting them. The RECONS group (www.recons.org) is dedicated to the study of nearby stars. Since 1994, we have discovered and characterized nearby red, brown, and white dwarfs, (Jao et al. 2005, 2014; Henry et al. 2006; Subasavage et al. 2009; Riedel et al. 2014). The team is currently constructing the RECONS 25 Parsec Database, which at present includes more than 3000 stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets with parallaxes greater than 40 mas and errors less than 10 mas. 

Much of the motivation of the K2 mission is to identify potentially habitable planets transiting stars that are close enough for detailed follow-up. Many nearby stars have been targeted for radial velocity (e.g., Chubak et al. 2012), transiting (e.g., Berta et al. 2013), and high-resolution imaging surveys (e.g., Horch et al 2012) to find close companions or planets. We propose to utilize the temporal monitoring in K2 fields 6 and 7 to observe the 6 nearest systems (including 7 components) with trigonometric parallaxes placing them closer than 25 pc. These stars are K5  M4 dwarfs and a white dwarf, a sample which covers the most abundant populations of our Galaxy. Of particular interest is the GJ0729 (M3.5V), which is the 9th closest star in our solar neighborhood.

Keplers long and short cadence data will allow us to search for transiting exoplanets around these nearby stars, none of which have yet been found to harbor planets.  To date, there are 978 confirmed planets discovered by Kepler, yet the closest planet, Kep-3b, is at 33 pc. Most of the systems either do not have parallaxes or are farther than 100 pc.  Although the odds of detecting a transit among only 7 targets is small, the variability data are valuable for astrophysical studies of the nearest stars and an investment in the future, should non-transiting planets eventually be discovered around these stars.  Month-long monitoring of the M dwarfs in particular can provide context for continuing RECONS work on M dwarf variability over timescales of 3-12 years, sampled at observing cadences of a few times/year (Jao et al. 2011; Hosey et al. 2014, accepted). In these studies we find that only 10% of M dwarfs vary by more than 20 mmag at optical wavelengths, implying that most M dwarfs are suitable for stable planetary environments.  These two campaigns are both in the south and can be observed at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m, where the RECONS variability data are taken.  Thus, we can set-up a complementary long-term variability monitoring program in conjunction to Keplers short-term data and will gather a full picture of the stars variability and flaring events, which are important to habitability of planets. We note that this proposal is similar to the one we submit for field 4 and 5 to observe 21 stars, which is currently under review."
GO7066,7,Gaspar,Aron,Bakos,Princeton University,gbakos@cfa.harvard.edu,"Espinoza, Nestor; Jordan, Andres; Brahm, Rafael Andres",Characterizing the confirmed transiting-hot-Jupiter systems HATS-9 and HATS-11 with K2 Short-Cadence Photometry,"Here we propose to observe two recently discovered transiting planet systems: HATS-9 (2MASS 19231442-2009587) and HATS11 (2MASS 19173618-2223236). The former, a V = 13.3 (Kepler magnitude 13.2), solar-type (T = 5400, Rstar = 1.5Rsun, M = 1Msun) star, is orbited by a very short-period hot-Jupiter (P=1.915d, Rp = 1.1Rjup, Mp = 0.84Mjup, Brahm et al., 2015, in prep.), while the latter is a V = 13.9 (Kepler magnitude 13.9), solar-type (T = 6000 K, Rstar = 1.4Rsun, M = 1Msun) star orbited by an inflated hot-Jupiter (P=3.62d, Rp = 1.5Rjup, Mp = 0.85Mjup, Rabus et al., 2015, in prep.). Both stars are on silicon in Field 7 of the K2 mission.

From the transit and radial velocity measurements for these targets, we estimate that the potential of detecting reflected light signatures is very high for both in comparison with all the confirmed Kepler planets, with HATS-9b showing (Rp/a)^2 ~ 300 ppm and HATS-11b showing (Rp/a)^2 ~ 250 ppm (for comparison, the median reflected light signature of planets with (Rp/a)^2 > 100 ppm is ~150 ppm). As such, these are very interesting targets for characterization with the K2 mission, whose high-precision photometry will be able to constrain the day-side emission of these planets through phase curve and secondary eclipse measurements. The latter is a very interesting measurement for both planets: on one hand, HATS-9b has a radius significantly smaller than planets with similarly high stellar irradiation levels which are as a consecuence very inflated, a fate that this planet has somehow avoided, while HATS-11b has a radius significantly larger than planets with similar stellar irradiation levels, indicating that both are atypical hot-Jupiters. We will also be able to determine the eccentricity of these systems, which is specifically important for HATS-9b, for which we have constrained it to be e < 0.129 (95% credibility upper limit). The importance of better constraining the eccentricity for this system comes from the fact that the stellar host is estimated to be old (11 Gyr) and, as such, one would expect the eccentricity to be zero due to tidal circularization; constraining it with high-precision K2 photometry will thus allow us to put orbital evolution models to test.

In addition to the science aims already mentioned above, the high-precision K2 photometry will also allow us to (1) further constrain important planetary parameters such as mass, radius and density for the targets, (2) constrain the possibility of additional planets via TTV and/or additional transits and (3) look for stellar oscillations in order to improve the stellar parameters. For these science aims to be met, we request short-cadence observations for these targets in order to have high-quality transit lightcurves given the 3.5h and 4.2h transit durations for HATS-9b and HATS-11b respectively."
GO7067,7,Gaspar,Aron,Bakos,Princeton University,gbakos@cfa.harvard.edu,"Hartman, Joel D; Mancini, Luigi",Observing high-priority transit candidates and eclipsing binaries from HATSouth with K2 long-cadence photometry,"We propose to observe 24 stars in campaign 7 of the K2 mission which have been selected as candidate transiting planets based on observations by the HATSouth survey. The transit signals found in the HATSouth light curves for these candidates have periods ranging from 0.6 days to 16.7 days. The candidates have V magnitudes ranging from 12.8 to 16.4. Follow-up spectroscopic observations have been carried out for 15 of these candidates, based on which 8 have been identified as eclipsing binaries and 7 remain active candidates. There are 9 other candidates which remain active, and have not yet received follow-up observations. Two of the candidates have high precision RV observations which vary in phase with the photometric ephemeris and strongly suggest that they are transiting hot Jupiter systems. We are requesting long-cadence observations for all 24 of these objects.

The K2 observations of these stars will serve several purposes: (1) confirming the transit detections for marginal candidates; (2) allowing us to rule out a variety of false positives by detecting secondary eclipses, large amplitude out-of-transit ellipsoidal variations, or differences in depth between even and odd transits; (3) providing high precision light curves to use in determining the properties of confirmed planets; (4) measuring the photometric rotation periods of the candidates; (5) for the 8 objects already found to be eclipsing binaries we will combine the high precision K2 light curves with our RV observations to determine the physical properties of the transiting M dwarf stars in these systems, we will also attempt an independent measure of the component masses through modelling the ellipsoidal and doppler boosting signals.

A similar proposal was previously submitted to follow-up HATNet candidates in K2 campaign 0. These observations allowed us to confirm a new well-characterized transiting planet (HTR220-003; Huang et al. 2015, in preparation) demonstrating the promise of our method.

This proposal is relevant to the NASA goal of finding and characterizing exoplanetary systems."

We propose to obtain high precision K2 photometry of the members of the open stellar cluster Ruprecht 147 (NGC 6774), which will be observed in K2 campaign 7, in order to search for transiting planets. Rup 147 is the oldest (~3Gyr) nearby open cluster.  Open clusters provide a homogeneous sample of stars in which the major independent variable is the stellar mass.  Thus, they provide an excellent laboratory for investigating the physics of planetary system formation and evolution.  These data for Rup 147, combined with C4 data for the Pleiades and Hyades, and with C5 data for M44 and M67, will help us to understand the formation and dynamical evolution of planetary systems as a function of stellar age and metallicity.  These clusters span a range of ages from 125Myr for the Pleiades up to 3-5 Gyr for M67.  Rup 147 provides much needed additional data for older clusters.   All of the clusters range from solar to slightly super-solar metallicity.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W. Cochran) and at KASI (led by Dr.  B.-C. Lee) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.  and will perform Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.

Targets:
We will propose approximately 100 targets.  They range in Kepler magnitude from 7.4 to 14.4, with most of the targets in the range 10 < Kp < 13.  Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2014, MNRAS in press, arXiv:1412.6304) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 100 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems.  These results will provide important new constraints on the physics of planetary system formation and early dynamical evolution, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates.  We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."
GO7071,7,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,"Rotation rates and ages of stars in wide binary systems, and a search for hierarchical triples","Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and chemical composition. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested  by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated (which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are). Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 6 and 7, we have identified a total of 77 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 45 seconds of arc. Our statistical analysis indicates that at least 70% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignment of unrelated stars). Half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. Most secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, most pairs can also be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target. One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, and thus a significant fraction of wide binaries are actually hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or event contact) binary star; we can test this prediction in our sample by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries. Relevance: this program will provide data on a set of important calibrators of stellar evolution models, which will have repercussions on the methods presently used to estimate the ages of low-mass stars - from which the ages of many exoplanet systems discovered by the Kepler mission are now evaluated."
GO7074,7,Geraldine,J,Peters,University of Southern California,gjpeters@mucen.usc.edu,"Wilson, R. E.",Gas Stream Dynamics in Algol-Type Interacting Binary Systems,"Scientific Goals: We propose K2 (long cadence) observations of eclipsing binary systems in Fields 6 and 7 to study the dynamics of mass transfer in interacting binaries of the Algol type. The project is inspired by our discovery of  a new class of short-period interacting binaries during Kepler Cycles 1-4.   Kepler  observation revealed that several systems with Algol-like light curves display unequal brightness at their quadrature phases and that the quadrature brightness ratio varies from  > 1 to <1 on a time scale of about 100-400 days (http://nexsci.caltech.edu/conferences/KeplerII/posters/peters.pdf). To our knowledge such behavior has never been reported from ground-based photometry.  We call these binaries L/T (Leading/Trailing hemisphere) variables.  The variability is likely due to changes in the sizes, temperatures, and locations of either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the location of the impact site and its migration serve as a diagnostic of stream dynamics in mass transferring Algols.  From new observations of Algols and related eclipsing binaries in K2 Fields 6 and 7, we will secure data that will characterize the location/motion of hot accretion spots. The location of impact site and the nature of its azimuthal motion will indicate whether the stream is magnetically-controlled or purely a result of hydrodynamic flow. Our investigation is part of a wider study of the detailed physics of mass transfer in Algols.

Number of Targets: 40 to 50 including Fields 6 & 7
We searched the regions centered on Fields 6 & 7 for eclipsing binaries with EA (eclipsing Algols) and  EB (eclipsing binaries of the beta Lyr type) designations using a 9.0º search radius. Several catalogs of variable stars were consulted including  Avvakumova et al. (2013), Malkov et al. (2006), Budding et al. (2004), the General Catalog of Variable Stars (Samus et al. 2013), and Simbad.  Systems with Kepler magnitudes between 6.0-14.0 were considered candidates for observation. There are several systems with Kepler magnitudes in the 8-10 range, for which K2 will yield an excellent S/N.

Methodology: As in our continuing project on the L/T variables in the Kepler Field, the K2 light curves will be modeled with the Wilson-Devinney (WD) program (Wilson & Devinney 1971, Wilson 2012 and references therein).  Stellar and spot parameters are determined.  We are currently exploring whether a migrating hot accretion spot on the primary and/or cool spots on the secondary can explain the quadrature light variability.

Relevance to the Solicitation: Only with the continuous photometric coverage of high precision provided by K2 can one identify binaries with unequal quadrature light and study the L/T phenomenon, as the variations are less  than 3% of the quadrature flux. One needs a continuous train of eclipse data over many orbital cycles to characterize the variability, including degree of the flux variations and its phase dependence.

Widely used in the asteroseismology of red giants, asteroseismic scaling relations connect stellar properties such as masses and radii to easy-to-derive seismic parameters such as the frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation. Although scaling relations do have some theoretical justification, they are still mostly based on the only star whose parameters we truly know: the Sun. The precise seismic K2 observations coupled with high-quality ground-based interferometric and spectroscopic data of bright nearby giants will allow us to subject the scaling relations to the most demanding tests. 
The second application is to constrain the poorly understood mixing processes working inside red giants, such as thermohaline mixing, rotation, and deep circulation. These processes are predicted to have different impact at different stages of red giant evolution, and to leave imprints in the surface chemical composition of a star. Precise seismic log (g) from K2 time series, coupled with high resolution spectroscopy, will allow for a detailed abundance determination of a large number of chemical species.  The correlations between elements (e.g. [C/ Fe] vs [N/ Fe]) and departure from their theoretically predicted values (as in the case of Li or 12 C/13 C) are tracers of internal mixing processes, and will be studied as a function of the seismically determined mass.
The third goal of this proposal is to address one of the biggest uncertainties in stellar astrophysics: the abundance of helium in stars. The helium second ionization zone inside a star produces an abrupt change in the local sound speed, which is detectable in the Fourier spectrum of time series as a periodic variation. We will construct detailed models of red giants where this variation is detected, and coupled with independent constraints on angular diameter and detailed surface composition, we will put stringent constraints on the helium abundance of red giants and test our assumptions on enrichment laws of the Galaxy.
We have selected ~25 bright (Kp~5-8) red giants which are ideally suited for this project due to their precisely determined distances, large angular sizes for interferometry, and detectable oscillations in the 80 day K2 baseline. Red giants observed by Kepler were generally too faint to meet these criteria, making K2 uniquely suited to perform these observations. Our proposal addresses compelling questions in stellar structure and evolution, and is hence directly related to the K2 GO solicitation."
GO7078,7,Ji,,Wang,Yale University,ji.wang@yale.edu,"Fischer, Debra Ann; Huang, Xu",Searching For Planets In Binary Stars,"Prior to the launch of the Kepler mission, we already knew that there are hundreds of binary stars in its field of view. For these binary stars, we find a striking deficiency of planets; none of these binary stars has a planet candidate. With K2 mission, we propose to observe more known binary stars to confirm the deficiency. We consider only S-type circumstellar planet system, in which a planet orbits one of the binary stars, NOT circumbinary planets (P-type).

Our sample consists of 1500 binary stars, which represents the largest sample of binary stars for planet search. This sample will put a strong constraint on the planet occurrence rate in binary stars, which we denote as f. We calculate f for different number of planet detections. Non-detection will give a 3-sigma upper limit of f at 9.5%, which confirms the deficiency and the suppressive influence of a stellar companion on planet formation. One or two detections will confirm the deficiency at 2-3 sigma level. More than two detections are deemed as unlikely given the Kepler main mission result.

Targeting binary stars with no prior information of planet helps to unambiguously address the planet occurrence rate in binary stars. Increasing the sample size helps not only to confirm the deficiency of planets in binary stars but also study the influence of stellar companions on planets with different sizes and orbital separations. Future NASA mission in search of habitable worlds will inevitably encounter with this question: to select binary stars or not, which account for 33% of stars in the solar neighborhood. This proposal will pave the way to solve this question."
GO7081,7,Daniel,,Huber,SETI Institute,daniel.huber@nasa.gov,"White, Timothy R; Aerts, Conny Clara; Silva Aguirre, Victor",Asteroseismology of the Brightest K2 Stars,"Science Goals and Objectives: The most powerful test of our understanding of stellar structure and evolution comes from the brightest stars in the night sky, for which complementary observational techniques (such as astrometry, asteroseismology, and interferometry) can be combined. So far, stars brighter than V < 5 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 long-cadence observations of the 10 brightest (V ~ 1-5 mag) K2 stars in campaign 6 & 7 using a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels (equivalent to 20 12th magnitude G-type stars per target). Asteroseismic studies of these bright targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for K giants and insights into poorly understood internal physical processes in A and B stars such convective core overshooting and internal differential rotation.

Methodology: Our targets will be selected from the Hipparcos catalog using a V < 5 mag cut, which yields 10 targets that fall on silicon in Campaign 6 and 7 (including Spica, a V=1 binary system with a 4 day period, ellipsoidal variability, and a gamma Cepheid variable primary component with a 4.2 hour pulsation period). We will use small (~20x20 pixel) circular apertures around the saturated core for each target, and perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method has been demonstrated to successfully recover pulsations of stars observed in K2 Campaign 0, as well as oscillations in saturated giants observed by Kepler. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Relevance to Solicitation: The proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics and the study of bright stars, both of which are key science goals of the K2 mission. In addition to pulsations, we expect to detect other astrophysical variability such as rotational modulation and ellipsoidal variations, which will give new insights into the physical nature and evolution of these bright stars. Additionally, our project may serendipitously yield the discovery of the brightest transiting exoplanet host star to date, in line with the key K2 science goal of detecting transits around bright stars."
GO7082,7,Katrien,,Kolenberg,University of Vienna,katrien.kolenberg@gmail.com,"Szabo, Robert; Molnar, Laszlo; Plachy, Emese; Banyai, Evelin",Investigating different populations of RR Lyrae stars with K2,"ABSTRACT:  RR Lyrae stars play a crucial role in astrophysics as standard candles, tracers of galactic history, and touchstones for modelling stellar pulsations. Space data of these crucial objects have led to a giant leap forward in our understanding of their structure and evolution, through the discovery of new dynamical phenomena. Moreover, insight into these stars dynamics is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. In this proposal we plan to study roughly 200-200 RR Lyrae stars in long cadence and 5-5 in short cadence in K2 Fields 6&7. Field 7 contains both galactic RR Lyraes and members of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream (Cseresnjes 2011, A&A 375, 909), and offers a unique chance to study two distinctly different populations. Moreover, K2's unique long, uninterrupted, high-precision space photometry, allows us conduct galactic structure studies and to improve our understanding of RR Lyrae pulsation and dynamics.

RESEARCH GOALS: 1. Throughout the K2 Mission we are building up a unique database from field to field covering different parts of our Galaxy and beyond (the Sgr dwarf galaxy in Field 7). Such an unprecedented photometric RR Lyrae sample will form the base of galactic structure studies and near-field cosmology. We will study the Galactic structure and history by obtaining distances to RR Lyrae stars and determine their spatial distribution (halo streams, over-densities). 2. The samples of K2 RR Lyrae data allow for a statistical analysis of various dynamical phenomena (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko-modulation, period-doubling, low-dimensional chaos, nonradial modes) and their occurrence rates to better understand their origin and their effect on distance determination. This can only be accomplished with K2. (In the nominal Kepler mission we had around 50 RR Lyrae stars on silicon.) 3. We will perform a detailed analysis of all RR Lyrae light curves, especially overtone and classical double-mode pulsators. The original Kepler field contained no RRd stars, and only a few RRc. This will aid the investigation of dynamical phenomena (resonances, mode interactions) that may be important in other types of pulsating stars, but can be studied in detail only in large-amplitude stars and with space photometry.

METHODS: We produce light curves from target pixel data (PyKE and own software), then apply corrections, trend-filtering, outlier removal, etc. Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. We derive metallicities from empirical relations using the light curve shapes and spectroscopic observations. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will help to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations. Targets. ~200 RR Lyrae stars will be proposed per field (5-5 for short cadence observations). Due to their distances, RR Lyrae stars are faint, the majority between 15-19 Kepler mag.

EXPERIENCE: Our team consists of members of the Working Group#7 (RR Lyrae and Cepheids) of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, who have been working on Kepler data (also preparation and target selection) since the launch of the nominal mission. We have experts on data reduction, pixel photometry, light curve and time-frequency analysis, as well as theorists performing numerical hydrodynamical modeling.

We propose short-cadence observations of known and high-probability pulsating WDs within the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. We additionally propose observations of known magnetic WDs to constrain magnetic activity and rotation rates in these stars.

As they cool, WDs stars with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres pulsate as DAVs (a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) when they reach the appropriate effective temperature to foster a hydrogen partial-ionization zone, which efficiently drives global oscillations. This range of temperatures empirically spans roughly 12,60011,100 K for typical-mass (0.6 Msun), log g = 8.0 WDs (Gianninas et al. 2011, ApJ, 743, 138). Pulsating WDs provide an important glimpse into the interior of the future of the vast majority (> 97%) of all stars in our Galaxy, including our Sun, allowing us to probe the masses and compositions of their electron-degenerate cores, as well as of their non-degenerate envelopes; to determine their internal rota- tion profiles; and to detect weak magnetic fields (see reviews by Winget & Kepler 2008 (ARA&A, 46, 157) and Fontaine & Brassard 2008 (PASP, 120, 1043).

Since the ZZ Ceti instability strip is defined by temperature, color selection is an excellent predictor of variability. Our team discovered all DAVs in the original Kepler mission, which has led to exquisite insight into WD interiors. We have applied the same photometric selection methods to K2 Fields 6 & 7, and have identified several WDs on silicon with colors consistent with the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. Since there is little SDSS overlap with K2 Fields 6 & 7, we have searched for new candidates using u', g', r' colors from the VST/ATLAS survey in the regions overlapping with Field 6 (no ATLAS data exists for Field 7). We have also searched for candidate DAVs from WDs with appropriate colors in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey (Rowell & Hambly 2011, MNRAS, 417, 93); this is how we discovered the first DAV in the original Kepler field (Hermes et al. 2011, ApJ, 741, L16). There is also one previously known, bright pulsating WD on silicon in Field 6: the DAV EC140121446 (V =15.5 mag).

Every new DAV we can observe with Kepler adds value, since it brings us that much closer to sta- tistically significant studies of WDs with ensemble asteroseismology (e.g. Chaplin et al. 2011, Science, 332, 213). To date, there are only six pulsating WDs with more than two weeks of Kepler observations, although several were observed in K2 Field 1. With typical pulsations ranging from 100  1400 s, we require short-cadence observations of these WDs. We expect to propose roughly 4 DAVs for Field 6 and 2 DAVs for Field 7. Minute-cadence K2 observations have the added benefit of catching transits/eclipses of the WD, revealing any unresolved double-degenerate binaries or even planetary companions.

Additionally, we propose observations of multiple strongly magnetic WDs in Fields 6 and 7 to carry out the first in-depth study into the magnetic activity of the endpoints of stellar evolution."

Due to their diversity in fundamental properties (masses, luminosities, chemical compositions), RGB stars are ideal targets to tackle two key unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of host star mass, and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets. We propose a survey of ~2000 low-luminosity RGB stars (with radii between ~3.5-8 solar radii) using long-cadence data to detect transiting gas-giant planets with K2 and address the above science questions by combining exoplanet transits and asteroseismology.

Methodology: Targets will be selected using colors and reduced proper motions. Planet candidates will be detected using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since RGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planet candidates. 

Relevance to Solicitation: The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing bright low-luminosity RGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

While M dwarfs offer some unique advantages, it is important to search for, characterize and understand exoplanets smaller than Neptune around stars closer in spectral type to our own. We propose to use K2 to carry out a search for transits of small planets around bright F, G and K stars. Small planets in such systems will be well suited to follow-up with radial velocity in order to determine their masses thanks to the brightness of the host stars. Stars with spectral types from late F to K should have sufficiently low vsini values, but also lower activity levels than M stars, therefore being ideal for RV measurements. They will also be suitable targets for atmospheric studies, and will make up a valuable sample for understanding how the structures, atmospheric compositions and orbital properties of these planets vary as a function of stellar spectral type. Ultimately, these measurements will enable us to constrain the formation and evolution of these planetary systems.

Target selection and expected yield: For our target selection, we began with all stars from the EPIC that fall on silicon during campaigns 6 and 7. We only kept stars with Kepler magnitudes brighter than 12 to ensure the ability to obtain mass determinations for the expected small transiting planets using high resolution spectrographs such as HARPS and HIRES. These systems will also be sufficiently bright to be accessible to current and upcoming space telescopes such as the HST, Spitzer, JWST and CHEOPS. Using a B-V colour cut, we then filtered out stars of types earlier than mid-F (B-V < 0.5) and later than M (B-V > 1.4). We further removed likely giants and subgiants by filtering out stars with proper motions smaller than 4 mas/yr. Our final sample of targets includes 2134 and 6838 stars in campaigns 6 and 7, respectively. From occurrence studies based on Kepler statistics of small planets around FGK stars, we expect to discover of the order of 70 new small planets during campaigns 6 and 7 as part of this survey.

Methodology: The majority of the targets we propose will be saturated. However, it has been demonstrated on both Kepler and K2 data that high-precision photometry is achievable even for saturated stars by using larger, customized apertures to ensure collection of all the light bled down columns and into adjacent pixels. We will use a similar method to extract photometry for saturated stars. Because centroiding will be difficult for those targets, we will use the pixel position of a nearby star to de-correlate the pixel position from the target photometry, an important step in analysing K2 data.

Relevance to ROSES 2014 and K2 GO - Cycle 1 solicitations: This proposal addresses the following NASA and K2 objectives and motivations: understand how small exoplanets form and determine the incidence of planets able to support life in the Universe. Specifically, this program will provide numerous bright systems hosting small planets amenable to follow-up studies that, together with the K2 data, will place constraints on their formation. It will also assess the composition and diversity of small planets around solar-type stars, thereby contributing to our understanding of how common life is in the Universe."

This is in great part due to the exquisite data that have been made available by NASAs Kepler space telescope, with detections of solar-like oscillations made in several hundred field stars, including a statistical sample of exoplanet hosts. Extension of Keplers capabilities to the ecliptic through the repurposed K2 mission thus offers a unique opportunity to continue asteroseismic studies of solar-type stars.

The aim of the present proposal is to perform an asteroseismic study of bright solar-type stars that reside in the solar neighborhood, making use of short-cadence (SC) data collected by K2 during Campaigns 8 (C8) and 10 (C10). The information contained in solar-like oscillations allows the internal stellar structure to be constrained to unprecedented levels, while also allowing fundamental stellar properties (e.g., mass, radius, and age) to be precisely determined. These results will be used in a variety of ongoing investigations that are relevant to this solicitation:
""	We seek to take advantage of the opportunity to observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed during the nominal mission, thus benefiting from better independent constraints (e.g., from parallaxes, spectroscopy, interferometry etc.). This will make it possible to apply the full potential of asteroseismology to tests of stellar interiors physics (e.g., placing constraints on convective overshooting).
""	By combining the targets observed during C8 and C10 with targets from previous K2 campaigns as well as from the nominal mission, we may study the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood and place constraints on the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars.
""	These targets will further expand the sample of benchmark stars having precise fundamental properties from asteroseismology to different fields in the Galaxy, which will be crucial to calibrate upcoming large surveys such as Gaia and GALAH.
""	The availability of precise asteroseismic ages of stars with detectable surface rotation periods will provide additional calibrators for gyrochronology.
""	Asteroseismology will allow us to better characterize targets with detected exoplanets, including any new detections made by K2 as well as known exoplanet-host stars. Bright solar-type hosts, for which asteroseismology and radial-velocity follow-up are available, provide the possibility to fill up the planet mass-radius diagram.
""	The possibility of detecting solar-like oscillations in members of stellar binaries provides an independent test to the accuracy of asteroseismic estimates of fundamental stellar properties.

Based on previous proposals, we estimate requesting for 30 to 40 targets per campaign. These targets should show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes, meaning that SC data are a pre-requisite for detecting the oscillations. We will be preparing analysis-ready light curves from the target pixel data using in-house software. Next, we shall apply well-tested analysis procedures to the frequency-power spectra of the light curves. These procedures will be used to estimate both the global seismic parameters and the parameters describing individual modes of oscillation (in particular their frequencies). Finally, detailed frequency modeling using state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes will provide the properties of the stars. An important aspect will be to understand the systematics on the derived properties that arise from changes in the input physics and the effects introduced by different evolutionary codes. The methodology delineated above has already been successfully applied to the analysis of K2 Campaign 1 data, for which we reached a very good understanding of the asteroseismic detection yield."

The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars needs to be rotating more slowly than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 2 and 10 days. 

The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. Many, but not all, Am stars therefore do pulsate, generally with lower amplitude than normal abundance delta Scuti stars. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars. 

Currently there are only two A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33 and Kepler-13A). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars. 

Using Kepler and K2, we have a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to: 
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binary within the Am stars, 
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars. 

Only 15 Am stars were observed during the original Kepler mission. So far with K2 a further 61 stars have been observed during K2 Campaigns 0 to 5. For this proposal we have 2 targets for Campaign 8 and 14 targets for Campaign 10 to be observed in Long Cadence mode. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to around 100.

The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."
GO8004,8,Mike,D,Reed,Missouri State University,mikereed@missouristate.edu,"Ostensen, Roy H.; Jeffery, Christopher Simon; Baran, Andrzej S; Telting, John",Understanding extreme horizontal branch stars using asteroseismology; including a known p-mode pulsator and MS companions,"We propose to explore core structure of horizontal branch (HB) stars by applying asteroseismological tools to Kepler data of extreme horizontal branch (spectral class subdwarf B) stars. Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars. Many happen to pulsate, and many of these are also in short-period binaries, and that provides us with sensitive probes of their structure. In C8, there is a known p-mode sdB star in a long-period binary with an FV star. This provides only the second rich p-mode example using Kepler, with binarity as a bonus! 
     From Kepler's main mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes, determine rotation periods, detect Doppler boosting, and to constrain structure models from period spacings, frequency multiplets, and subsynchrous rotators via binarity. From K2 (F0 and F1), we have found the longest-period sdB+M binary and the first subsynchronously rotating ellipsoidal variable; both with pulsating sdB stars!
     Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age since some stars show substantial mode trapping while in others it appears to be absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of different evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models and see how HB cores evolve.
     Frequency multiplets also tell us the rotation period and orientation of the pulsation axis. From this information we have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary period down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components; allowing us to explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection.
     We have made significant progress and amazing discoveries from the original Kepler mission and our first K2 targets. However, to fully exploit those advances, we need to complete the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). And C8 includes a known p-mode pulsator, which would be only the second one observed by Kepler, providing extremely valuable information.
     To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of two pulsating sdB stars in C8 and C10, with PG 0048 in C8 an already established pulsator.
     Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.
     We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include graduate and undergraduate students as significant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training."

The first goal is to characterize the variability of 3C 273 on timescales from minutes to months using continuous observations for 75 days, which has never been done before. Our  second goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in the quasars at the time of K2 observations. The three candidate origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk (AD) with one or more thermal emitting regions. Our third  goal is to see how the optical variability amplitude and power spectral densities (PSDs) of the three main classes of quasars --blazars, radio-loud quasars, and radio-quiet quasars --differ on minute-to-months timescales. The candidate origins for optical emission from radio-loud quasars are the same as those for blazars, but without enhanced relativistic beaming in the jet. Optical variations in radio-quiet quasars may originate in an AD with multiple thermal emission regions. We will measure the PSDs of the light curves and determine the PSD slopes which are related to the underlying variability processes, such as turbulence in the relativistic jets or stochastic fluctuations in thermal emission from segments of the AD."
GO8006,8,Mukremin,,Kilic,University of Oklahoma,kilic@ou.edu,"Mullally, Fergal; Loeb, Abraham; Debes, John Henry; Agol, Eric",Habitable Planets Around White Dwarfs in Fields 8 and 10,"The search for planets in the habitable zone has so far focused on solar-type stars and M dwarfs. However, transiting planets in the habitable zone around white dwarfs (WDs) may be common  and they provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on an exoplanet. The habitable zone around WDs extends from 0.005 AU to 0.02 AU (P = 4-30 h, Agol 2011) for WDs older than about 1 Gyr. Since WDs are slightly larger than Earth, Earth-size and even smaller planets can easily be detected. We expect the planets within 1 AU of solar type stars to be destroyed in the giant phase. Hence, planets in the habitable zone around WDs must arrive there after this phase. There are several ways to form such planets near the WD or bring them closer (see the Kepler white paper by our team). Planets have been detected around evolved, post-main-sequence stars. In addition, tidally disrupted asteroids and dwarf planets have been detected around 4.3% of WDs in the form of debris disks. If the history of exoplanet science has taught us anything, it is that planets are ubiquitous and they exist in the most unusual places, including very close to their host stars and even around pulsars. 

Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability of the Kepler 2 mission to perform a transit survey of the WDs in Fields 8 and 10. Using spectroscopy, photometry, and astrometry data from the McCook & Sion White Dwarf catalog, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the SuperCosmos Sky Survey, we identify 273 WDs on active silicon in Fields 8 and 10. We propose LC observations of all WD targets. 

SC observations would have the best constraints on transiting planets around WDs. However, given the small number of SC slots available, LC mode data will still enable us to achieve our science goals. Planets in the habitable zone would eclipse their stars for about 2 min. Hence, the LC mode data will dilute the transit signal by a factor of 15. However, since the transit depth is >50% for an Earth-size or bigger planet around an average size WD, these transits will have >3% depth in the LC data, and they will still be visible. Even with the decreased sensitivity of the 2wheel mode, Kepler can still detect transits of Earth-size or bigger planets around WDs. 

The probability for a transit by an Earth-size planet at 0.01 AU is 1%. Hence, the discovery of habitable planets around WDs requires a survey of at least 100 targets, if all of them have such planets. Previously, we proposed for K2 observations of about 500 target WDs in Fields 0-7. The addition of the 273 WDs from Fields 8 and 10 will bring the total number of WDs surveyed by the K2 mission to about 770. This survey will provide the first constraints on the frequency of habitable planets around WDs. Our proposed survey is relatively cheap due to the relatively small number of WD targets in Fields 8 and 10 . On the other hand, this survey is capable of finding the first planets in the WD habitable zone, and the James Webb Space Telescope is capable of obtaining the first spectroscopic measurements of such planets. 

In addition to the transit search, the 30-min cadence of the LC data is well suited for measuring the rotation periods for a large number of WDs for the first time. WDs have typical rotation periods of a few hours to a few days, though there are only a handful of measurements available. Kepler's precision provides an excellent opportunity to measure the rotation periods for our targets, including the ones with relatively weak magnetic fields. We have already analyzed the K2 data from Fields 0 and 1, and identified a 2.4h period eclipsing double WD system (paper in prep) and detected variability in about a dozen WDs. The former system displays 70s long eclipses (as confirmed from the ground), and demonstrates our team's ability in making excellent use of the K2 data."
GO8007,8,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transits,"To date almost nothing is known about the final (WD) configuration of ~97% of planetary systems! While not a single bona-fide planet has been identified orbiting an isolated WD (Faedi+2011,MNRAS 410, 899), it is now widely accepted that the dusty and/or gaseous disks that we see within one solar radius around many WDs are produced by the tidal disruption of asteroids (Farihi+2010, MNRAS 404, 2123). An increasing fraction of WDs (>=27%) show a metal enrichment due to the fall into the WD atmosphere of ancient planetary material (Koester+2014, A&A 566, 34), whose chemical composition is similar to that seen in different Solar-system meteorites (Gansicke+2012, MNRAS 424, 333).
Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and the AGB phases (Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). While Gaia will discover WD planets at several AUs from their host stars, those external to the period gap (Silvotti+2014, arXiv1412.3307), this proposal aims to study the inner boundary of the period gap. Substellar companions to sdB stars offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion, thermal pulses and PN ejection, Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ 761, 121), and they represent the natural 1st step to study the post-RGB evolution of planetary systems and their final architecture. Star/planet interactions during the RGB may be responsible for the stellar envelope ejection leading to the formation of a single sdB star (Soker 1998, AJ 116, 1308; Han+2012, PASP Conf.Ser. 452, 3).
Among 18 planet/BD candidates around sdB stars (Silvotti+2014, ASP Conf.Ser. 481, 13), 2 planetary systems were detected by Kepler measuring the photometric modulation due to reflection/re-emission of the star light (Charpinet+2011, Nature 480, 496; Silvotti+2014, A&A 570, 130). Given that only 7 single sdBs were observed by Kepler for enough time to detect tiny photometric variations of 20-50 ppm, we can assume that 2/7 of sdBs have Earth-size bodies in tight orbits at ~0.005 AU from the star. With a geometric transit probability of 0.2 (Rp<<RsdB, RsdB=0.001 AU), the prob. to see a transit is about 0.057, i.e., in average, we need to observe ~18 sdB stars to see one transit. 
Similar numbers are obtained for the more massive companions detected through RVs: Geier et al. 2012 (ASP Conf. Ser. 452, 153) found that 16% of their sample of 27 single-lined sdBs do show small RV variations compatible with massive substellar companions. Here the geom. transit probability at 0.005 AU is ~0.28 (Rp=0.9 Rjup) so that, in average, 1 sdB out of ~22 should show transits and secondary eclipses.
The main goal of this proposal is to detect sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targetting in SC ~40 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. SC is required as the typical transit duration for a close planet with 6h<Porb<24h is 15 to 40 min.
The transit depth may vary between 25% (Jovian radius) down to 0.2% (Earth radius). Given the high number of transits in a ~90 days observation, K2 should be able to measure objects with a radius smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, PEPSI@LBT (presently in commissioning) and EXPRESSO@VLT (first light in 2016) will be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.
The secondary goal of this proposal is to detect photometric variations due to reflection effects by a faint stellar companion, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting. Kepler has already given an important contribution to this field. K2 can increase by a factor 5 to 10 the statistics of well studied sdB+WD and sdB+M-dwarf systems.

Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy. 

Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012). For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission. 

The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars. 

Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem. 

Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013). 

Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. Several hundred of them (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields from 2014 to 2016. For fields 8-10, observed in 2016, we propose to include ~100 targets in the K2 fields for these campaigns for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them will fall onto the Kepler chips. For the subsequent fields we will submit similarly sized numbers of objects. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner in the context of a PhD project supervised by all three co-investigators."

Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system [1-5], colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk [6-7], and studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength which may limit models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration of planetesimals. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies.

Light curves of Hilda asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. This population is in the stable 3:2 resonance with Jupiter at 4 AU and collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations [8-9]. Results from the WISE survey suggest that  ~40% of Hilda asteroids are either extremely elongated objects, or are binaries[10]. Kepler optical light curves are required to confirm these controversial findings. Ground based optical surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability survey. Large amounts of observing time are required, and analysis of lightcurves obtained over a few nights is hampered by aliasing induced by limited photometric sampling over regularly spaced nightly intervals. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform.

We have identified ~12 objects for study in the Hilda asteroid populations to be studied with Kepler in Campaigns 8 & 10 with magnitudes of m_V < 20. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 40 days for our targets. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity to test the results reported by the WISE survey.

GO8011,8,Steven,,Kawaler,Iowa State University,sdk@iastate.edu,,Search for rotational modulation in precise photometry of white dwarf stars,"This program will use very sensitive photometric observations of white dwarfs by Kepler/K2 during Campaigns 8 and 10 to search for rotational modulation of the flux from low-magnetic field white dwarf stars caused by magnetic phenomena (such as starspots and plages). On the expected white dwarf rotation periods (about 1 day, generalizing from nonradially pulsating white dwarfs), the low amplitude of the expected variations renders them extremely difficult to detect using ground-based photometry. K2 will be able to observe many well-studied field (and cluster) white dwarfs. Measurement of rotation modulation (or even upper limits to photometric amplitude variations) will further exploit those data to teach us about magnetic fields in these stars that are otherwise inaccessible observationally. In the nonradially pulsating white dwarfs, we can independently measure the rotation rate, providing a test of asteroseismic rotation periods."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is know about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. However, our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed in campaigns 8 and 10 of the Kepler K2 mission identifies 2,926 high-velocity subdwarfs that are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, to identify and characterize the first generation of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will be complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."
GO8013,8,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,Rotation rates for stars in wide binary systems and a search for hierarchical triples,"Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and chemical composition. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated (which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are). Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 8 and 10, we have identified a total of 219 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 60. Our statistical analysis indicates that at least 80% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignment of unrelated stars). Half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. Most secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, most pairs can also be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target. One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, and thus a significant fraction of wide binaries are actually hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or event contact) binary star; we can test this prediction in our sample by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries."

Kepler monitored 15 of these systems with results currently published for 8. The detailed coverage enabled unique studies of quiescent orbital and sporadic variability as well as the changes in the disk and stream impact area during short and long dwarf nova outbursts. We propose to monitor a set of CVs in the K2 fields of Campaigns 8 and 10. We have matched the Cycle 3 fields with several CV databases and expect a total of about 11 targets will be requested in this cycle. These data will extend the range of CV types studied with Kepler's unprecedented continuous, fast-candence observations."
GO8015,8,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Xue, Zhichao; Landolt, Arlo U; Clem, James L",How Constant are Standard Stars?,"How constant are standard stars?  Of the original 104 standard stars for Johnson's UBV system, 80% are known or suspected variables (Landolt 2013).  The Landolt standards have typical single-measurement errors of 1.4% in the V, and with averages of 15 individual observations on 8 nights (Landolt 1992), so many types of variability will be missed.  Similarly, the Sloan u'g'r'i'z' standard stars have accurately-measured average-magnitudes, but the variability for individual stars could be as large as 1%-3%.  According to R. Bohlin, the three primary standard stars for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) could easily be variable at the 1% level.

If the variability of standard stars is at the 1%-3% level, it would become critical for several large-scale enterprises in astrophysics.  For example, the massive efforts to use supernovae for cosmology now have the calibration error for the standard stars as the largest uncertainty in the error budget (e.g., Amanullah et al. 2010), so the only way to advance in our knowledge of Dark Energy is to get better standard stars.  The supernova community has set the ambitious goal of calibration to the 1% level, so standards are needed to much better than the 1% level.  All these efforts and goals are denied if the standard stars themselves vary at the 1% level, or if even some substantial fraction vary at the 0.5% or 0.3% level.

Ground-based and HST space-based observations have proven ineffective at testing standard stars for variability at smaller than the 1%-3% level.  But Kepler is perfect for testing standard stars for variability down to the millimag level over a very wide range of timescales.  But to make any such test, the standards must be in the Kepler field of view.  Most standards are either along the equator or far from the ecliptic.  For all of the K2 fields 0-13, it turns out that standard stars are only visible in K2 Fields 8 and 10.  So K2 Cycle 3 is the only opportunity to measure the real variability of standard stars.

We have identified 25 Landolt standards in Field 8, 11 Landolt standards in Field 10, and 7 Sloan standards in Field 10.  These standards are from 11th to 16th mag, right in Kepler's sweet-spot, so we will get better than millimag accuracy for all our targets.  We propose to use K2 to get long-cadence light curves to test all 41 stars for their levels of variability.  Our analysis will consist of performing Fourier transforms seeking periodic variations, the calculation of the RMS variability on long and short timescales (with correction for Poisson noise), a flare search, and the peak-to-peak variations on timescales long enough so that Poisson noise does not dominate.  Our product will be the full characterization of the variability of all 70 standard stars, resulting in fractions of stars of various types that are variable at greater than several levels.

The results of our K2 Cycle 3 program will have far reaching effects.  If we find that some substantial fraction of standards have variability at the 0.5% level or more, then the many communities will have to work hard to solve the problem.  Our results might point to some type of standards as having the lowest variability.  Our results can quantify how many standard star observations are needed to beat down the variability each night.  Or if we find variability to be common and large enough, then this would point to a path involving NIST-calibrated light sources flown in the upper atmosphere.

RELEVANCE:  NASA-funded experiments need calibration to the 1% level, so standard stars need be constant to much better than 1%, yet current measures of standards have not gotten tests below the 1%-3% level.  Only the K2 mission can measure the real low-amplitude variability of standard stars, and these are only visible during Cycle 3 (i.e., Fields 8 and 10).

GO8016,8,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Hudson, Hugh S",Superflares on RS CVn and BY Dra Stars,"It came as a startling surprise when otherwise-ordinary G-type main sequence stars (including some of the closest known solar twins) were discovered to have flares with energies 10^34 to 10^39 ergs (Schaefer et al. 2000).  These 'superflares' have durations from minutes to days, amplitudes up to 3 mags, and emission from X-ray to radio.  Kepler has made for a revolution in superflares by providing large event numbers on many Sun-like stars (Maehara et al. 2012; Schaefer 2012).  The most popular current model has reconnection of the magnetic fields stretching between the Sun-like star and a nearby planet (Rubenstein & Schaefer 2000; Lanza 2008).  This scenario was explicitly stealing the model for RS CVn superflares.

RS CVn stars are G-type main sequence stars in close orbit (1-14 day orbital periods) around cooler stars, with synchronization speeding up the stellar rotations and hence increasing greatly the magnetic activity of the stars.  BY Dra stars are similar to RS CVns, with a somewhat cooler surface and sometimes apparently single.  RS CVn and BY Dra stars have occasional superflares, with energies up to 10^38 erg, durations from hours to a day, amplitudes up to 1.6 mag, and emission from X-ray to radio.  Models for RS CVn superflares all involve magnetic reconnection with loops stretching between the G-star and the cool star (Simon et al. 1980; Ferreira 1998).  The difference in energy between solar flares and RS CVn superflares is that the loop length could be much longer and the surface field much stronger.  The field configuration, trigger, and detailed microphysics of RS CVn superflares are poorly known (Ferreira 1998).

A small number of RS CVn superflares have been reasonably observed from X-ray to optical to radio.  Nevertheless, there are two glaring problems in the RS CVn data:  First, the coverage has been much too haphazard and gap-filled, so demographic properties are badly known.  Second, only the largest RS CVn superflares have been detected and reported, leaving it completely unknown as to the existence, frequency, and properties of any low-amplitude events.

We propose to use the K2 mission to monitor RS CVn and BY Dra stars for superflares.  K2 can uniquely solve the two big problems because the relentless gapless coverage for ~80 days will provide uniform and biasfree flare searches, and because the millimag accuracy allows for the confident detection of superflares with amplitudes over two orders-of-magnitude smaller.  No RS CVn star was targeted in the original Kepler  field or in any K2 field, other than the 25 RS CVns and 2 BY Dra stars that we proposed for Fields 4-7.

We have identified 8 RS CVn stars and 2 BY Dra stars (in Fields 8 and 10) brighter than 16th mag that K2fov gives as being on-chip.  For flares found, amplitudes, durations, orbital phases, energy estimates, and light curves would be published, along with demographic results like size-frequency distributions.  The great statistics from K2 will be able to perform tests like measuring the orbital phase dependence of flare frequency so as to distinguish between the magnetic loop and the magnetospheric tail reconnection models.

RELEVANCE:  RS CVn and BY Dra superflares fit into a larger picture of superflares on Sun-like stars, with these other superflares having similar observational properties.  A goal of this K2 proposal is to test how similar are the types of superflares, with this having good relevance for NASA's goal of understanding the biggest solar flares.  Only the K2 mission has the gapless long-term coverage with millimag accuracy as required to spot large and small superflares.

E.",K2 Observations of Variable White Dwarfs in Fields 8 and 10,"We propose observations of variable white dwarfs in Fields 8 & 10 of the K2 mission. We propose short-cadence observations of known and high-probability pulsating white dwarfs within the empirical DAV instability strip. We additionally propose observations of known magnetic and convective-atmosphere white dwarfs to constrain magnetic activity in these stars.

As they cool, white dwarf stars with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres pulsate as DAVs (a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) when they reach the appropriate effective temperature to foster a hydrogen partial-ionization zone, which efficiently drives global oscillations. This range of temperatures empirically spans roughly 12,600-11,100 K for typical-mass (0.6 Msun), log g = 8.0 white dwarfs (Gianninas et al. 2011, ApJ, 743, 138). Pulsating white dwarfs provide an important glimpse into the interior of the future of the vast majority (> 97%) of all stars in our Galaxy, including our Sun, allowing us to probe the masses and compositions of their electron-degenerate cores, as well as of their non-degenerate envelopes; to determine their internal rotation profiles; and to detect weak magnetic fields (see reviews by Winget & Kepler 2008 (ARA&A, 46, 157) and Fontaine & Brassard 2008 (PASP, 120, 1043).

Since the DAV instability strip is defined by temperature, color selection is an excellent predictor of variability. Our team discovered all DAVs in the original Kepler mission, which has led to exquisite insight into white dwarf interiors. We have applied the same photometric selection methods to K2 Fields 8 & 10 using the SDSS, and have identified 15 excellent candidate white dwarfs on silicon in each field with colors consistent with the empirical DAV instability strip. Additionally, there are five previously known, confirmed pulsating white dwarfs in Field 8 (SDSS J0052-0051, GD 842, SDSS J1112+0009, WD J0050-0023, WD J0111+0018) and three in Field 10 (PG 1159-035, WD J1200-0251, and WD J1244-0221). Notably, PG1159-035 (V=15.0 mag) was the subject of one of the first Whole Earth Telescope runs -- a coordinated global multi-site campaign in 1989 March (Winget et al. 1991, ApJ, 378, 326) -- and is one of the best-studied and richest pulsating white dwarfs known.

Every new pulsating white dwarf we can observe with Kepler adds value, since it brings us that much closer to statistically significant studies of white dwarfs with ensemble asteroseismology (e.g. Chaplin et al. 2011, Science, 332, 213). With typical pulsations ranging from 100-1400 s, we require short-cadence observations of these white dwarfs. Minute-cadence K2 observations have the added benefit of catching transits/eclipses of the white dwarf, revealing any unresolved double-degenerate binaries or even planetary companions.

Additionally, we propose observations of multiple convective and/or possibly magnetic white dwarfs in Fields 8 and 10 to carry out the first in-depth study into the magnetic activity of the endpoints of stellar evolution. These long-baseline photometric observations will test white dwarf variability on a large scale and in a completely new regime."

The small size of a white dwarf (WD) star (approx. 1 Earth radii) implies that any sub-stellar or gas giant companion at suitable orbital inclination will completely eclipse it, while terrestrial bodies smaller than the Moon, including asteroids, will still produce transits that are detectable in high signal/noise light-curves.

Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approx. 25% at circa 1Gyr, Zuckerman et al.2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.

The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically signicant (500 to 1000) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a signicant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).

A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al.(2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al.(2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD?

This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery. 

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm (5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 169 and 108 WDs (campaigns 8 and 10 respectively), that have been spectroscopically identified or are deemed to have a 90% or greater probability of being a WD (Fusillo et al. 2015), and which are brighter than Kepler Magnitude 19.5 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues."
GO8020,8,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,,Short-Duration Flares on Mira Stars in Fields 8 & 10,"Mira stars are slowly pulsating red giant stars with periods of order a year, so it came as a startling surprise when they were discovered to have short-duration flares (Schaefer 1991).  These flares were observed with amplitudes 0.4 to 1.4 mag and durations from 3 minutes to 3 hours, and were visible in both the optical and the radio.  Mira flares have been confirmed by Maffei & Tosti (1995), de Laverny et al. (1998), and Stencel et al. (2003), with flare durations lasting up to 6 days.  However, studies by Mais et al. (2004), Wozniak et al. (2004), and Lebzelter (2011) have failed to find any flares on various samples of red giants.  It is currently unclear what subset of Mira stars and what phases show flares, no detailed models have been made, and we have little knowledge of flare demographics.  Models of Mira flares (e.g., Struck et al. 2002) point to magnetic reconnection involving planets orbiting the Mira star.
	
The original Kepler mission did look at 317 M giant stars, but this includes only two classic Mira stars (Banyai et al. 2013).  They do not report any flares, but they only report on Fourier transforms for periods longer than a day, so this study was not sensitive to Mira flares.  Nevertheless, this study provides a proof that Kepler can follow Mira stars with 30-minute time resolution and ~0.1 millimag accuracy.  I have already made successful K2 proposals for 3+32+3+2+2+47 Miras in Fields 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  I have already fully analyzed data for five Miras (for a total of 0.84 Mira-years) and have found no flares down to 0.7 millimag amplitude.  With Mira flares being rare, perhaps once in several years when averaged over all Miras, an accumulation of many years of exposure is required to get significant demographics for flares.  For K2 Fields 8 & 10, I have selected 1 and 3 targets, all confirmed Mira variables that are always brighter than V=16.  
	
I propose to have Kepler monitor 4 Mira stars during the K2 mission for Fields 8 & 10, with the 30-minute cadence, with the goal to be to discover flares from a few minutes to days in duration.  The analysis is to run the light curve through a flare finder as used for Gamma-Ray Burst triggering, because this is an identical task of searching for flares of unknown time, size, and shape on a roughly-sinusoidal varying background, with a 5.5 sigma threshold accounting for the many time intervals over the many stars.  This statistical limit will be applicable to fast flares, with our experience showing that the real limit is imposed by 'faint' cosmic rays that cannot be recognized by changed PSFs.  For flares found, amplitudes, durations, phases, energy estimates, and light curves would be published, along with demographic results like size-frequency distributions.
	
RELEVANCE.    Ground-based light curves are notoriously difficult to find small rare flares, while the Kepler satellite solves this due to having sub-millimag accuracy and a relentless light curve without gaps for many months.  So Kepler is unique at being able to address the many big unknowns regarding Mira flares.  My small K2 program will increase the number of Mira stars monitored by Kepler from 2 (for the original Kepler field) to 95 (with Fields 0-10), and so will make such a big advance that it has the potential for solving many of the questions.  K2 will provide the first accurate and full-coverage light curve for the startling flares on Mira stars, and will give detailed demographic properties, like flare frequency/size/duration as a function of Mira type, period, and phase.

stars. Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with
the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations,
multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have
accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate
parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR
diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes and photometry,
we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What
stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to
be up to three full magnitudes in width? In order to answer this
question, we need to understand their multiplicity,
metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation
rates.  The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the
relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters
discussed above. Because of the limited precision on the ground based
observations to measure rotation periods, we propose to utilize the K2
mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25
pc to accurately determine their rotation rates. In K2 fields 8 and
10, we will observe seven nearby systems, including three K and four M dwarfs. We expect to have the most complete characterization of a set of the nearest K and M stars in all K2 fields that has ever been accomplished."

The goal is to record via the LC mode the long term photometric variability in each of these systems. Long term variability in several CV system types is known to be due to precession -- tidal torques by the secondary star on the disk around the primary star. For the first time ever, Kepler found in previous campaigns a long term variability in Algol systems, with WX Dra from Kepler Quarters 2-4, 6-8, 10-12, and 14-16 being the poster system. This long term variability has never been observed and confirmed from the ground, necessitating the need for the K2 campaigns. In this work, we hypothesize the source to this long term variability in Algol systems as a precession. Through modeling of the CV and Algol light curves, we aim to determine the type of precession in the Algol systems (i.e., whether prograde or retrograde) and to identify the source to the modulated light (e.g., from a precession of a bright/hot spot hitting a disk around the primary in the Algol, from a precession of a bright/hot spot hitting the primary's photosphere, from a precession of the disk, etc. and not due to star spots or exoplanets). As CVs and Algols share the same dynamics of the mass transfer process in close binary systems and the largest difference between CVs and Algols is the orbital period (or, similarly, the separation distance), this K2 study naturally fits into the long term goals of further establishing the connections between these two types of close binary systems and the evolutions of these star systems. In addition to the K2 observations, we will also observe some of these K2 target candidates (and other like systems) from the ground to establish a photometric modulation baseline. To complete these tasks, we have put together a team of experts in CVs and Algols and we include two students."

So far, stars brighter than Kp < 6 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 long-cadence observations of the brightest (Kp < 6.3 mag) K2 stars in campaign 8 & 10 using a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels. Asteroseismic studies of these targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants and insights into poorly understood internal processes of intermediate-mass stars such as convective core overshooting.

We selected 18 targets including A stars and red giants with Kp < 6.3 mag from the Hipparcos catalog. We will use small (~20x20 pixel) circular apertures around the saturated core for each target, and perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method has been demonstrated to successfully recover pulsations of saturated giant stars observed in K2 Campaign 1. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Our proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics, a key science goal of the K2 mission. Our project furthermore supports galactic astrophysics, another key science area identified in the NRA, through the calibration of scaling relations for galactic archeology studies. A better understanding of stellar models through the study of bright stars is relevant for science goals pursued by both present and future NASA missions such as the characterization of exoplanets (TESS, JWST) as well as stellar populations and galaxy formation/evolution (HST, JWST)."
GO8026,8,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,,Flaring Properties and Sunspots among Old Halo G and K Dwarfs,"Goals

This proposal is to characterize the flaring properties of old G and K dwarfs over the long term. The primary goal is to evaluate whether the Sun itself might undergo a powerful flare in the future. The secondary goal is to characterize the degree to which an old G or K dwarf flares as a function of its temperature, and to establish whether G and K dwarfs generally have sunspot cycles like that of the Sun. 

To this end we request Kepler light curves for the ~1200 on-silicon stars with 17.0 < Kp < 18.6 likely to be remote G or K dwarfs in the subregion of the field of C8 that is contained in Stripe 82, a region observed many times with SDSS, both in photometry and spectroscopy. By itself this yields for each star an indication of its flaring activity over about a decade, but at a cadence ill-suited to determining the characteristics of each individual flare.

Methods and results

The proposed Kepler 2 light curves at long cadence will allow the true frequency and energy of individual superflares to be detected and determined for each star over a 75+ day interval. These will be compared to the historical SDSS record of flaring, established through photometric variations. We also show that the temperature of each G or K dwarf can be established to about 100K from its (g-r)o color alone, for a characterization of flaring as a function of stellar temperature.

K2 light curves also will provide measurements of the rotation period for all stars with significant sunspots, through semi-periodic variations of the amplitude of one to a few percent over periods of one to several dozen days. This too will be correlated against flaring properties, both from K2 and from SDSS. 

As our value-added community resource contribution, we will publish a complete flaring history for each star, combining our results from both the SDSS photometry and the K2 LC light curves. From this work we can determine, as a function of stellar temperature and mass, what fraction of old G and K dwarfs experience strong flaring, whether such stars undergo cycles of activity resembling the 11/22-year solar sunspot cycle, and to what extent flaring occurs as a function of sunspot activity. Since in these old stars the global dynamo has spun down, this will help to characterize the role of global versus local dynamos in strong flaring, and provide a better estimate of whether the Sun might undergo flaring in the future.



Relevance to the K2 solicitation and need for new K2 observations

Kepler 2 is the only means currently available that is capable of obtaining light curves of sufficient sensitivity, 1% or better, on large numbers of faint dwarfs. We target faint dwarfs in the halo field C8 because these are located at least 850pc above the Galactic plane, and therefore are old stars like the Sun. M dwarfs flare extensively, but the flaring mechanism may differ from that of the Sun due to their extremely deep convective envelopes. Flaring studies based on Kepler observations have detected energetic flares in G dwarfs, but due to the line of sight near the Galactic plane of the Kepler field, these Kp ~14.5 mag stars lie only 250pc above the plane, and may be young stars. Other halo K2 fields have very few faint dwarf observations. Equally important is the existence in C8 of dwarfs with Stripe 82 observations, providing an intermittent history over more than a decade of photometric and spectroscopic indications of flaring.

For these reasons, that K2 is unique in its capability and that C8 Stripe 82 offers an unprecedented prior record of flaring, new K2 observations are required. Thus this proposed work is responsive to the K2 call for Campaign 8."
GO8027,8,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,"Sharma, Sanjib; Stello, Dennis",Identifying K Giants of the Remote Halo with K2 in C8 and C10,"Goals

The goal of this proposal is to identify a significant new sample of red giants in the halo of the Galaxy at large distances, 50 to 100 kpc and beyond. These are the best tracers of the remote halo, for at their high luminosities they remain visible to 100 kpc, and their presence in populations of all metallicities and ages ensures an unbiased sample of the stellar population.

The primary difficulty in their identification is distinguishing them from foreground dwarfs, which form the overwhelming majority of stars at these magnitudes and colors. Roughly 300 giants at distances > 50 kpc spread over the sky have now been identified from SDSS SEGUE spectra, but with a bias towards low metallicities and hotter giants, introduced by the selection criteria for targeting stars for SEGUE spectral observations to increase the giant yield.

Methods

Here we propose to identify the redder, cooler, more luminous giants, where the u-g vs. g-r diagram provides some giant-dwarf discrimination. We propose K2 long-cadence light curves for six hundred potential luminous red giants with 0.9 <= (g-r)o <= 1.3, to identify such giants by detecting and measuring nu_max, the peak in the power spectrum due to solar-like (p-mode) oscillations. In these cool, luminous stars such peaks are detectable even at faint magnitudes using long-cadence data. In contrast, the power-spectrum peaks of the intervening dwarfs will not be detected at all, due to their higher frequencies and lower amplitudes. As standards we add sixty stars with 0.7 <= (g-r)o <= 1.2 already identified as giants.

In addition to the (g-r)o limits, which restrict their temperatures to cooler than 4600K, our six hundred potential red giants on-silicon in the C8 and C10 fields meet several additional criteria. Chief among them is a cutoff in the SDSS u-g vs. g-r color-color diagram, where dwarfs and giants diverge. This promises a yield well above the 3% achieved by SEGUE, and has a reduced bias towards low metallicity. The targets meeting these criteria have 16.2 <= Kp < 18.5. Follow-up spectroscopy is feasible with multi-object spectrographs in both hemispheres, but is not needed to determine temperatures, nor for a first estimate of metallicity.

By comparing the ugri colors of Castelli & Kurucz (2003) model atmospheres to the observed SDSS photometry of stars known to be giants, we have shown that the temperature of a red giant in a halo field of low reddening such as C8 and C10 is determined to 100K from its g-r color alone. Because nu_max is sensitive primarily to stellar surface gravity, its value as determined from K2 power spectra, coupled with Teff from g-r, sets the luminosity of the giant. Because giant luminosity at a given g-r is a function of stellar metallicity, this provides a reasonable estimate of [Fe/H] for each detected giant.

Relevance to the K2 solicitation and need for new K2 observations

Kepler 2 is the only means currently available that is capable of distinguishing red giants from dwarfs for hundreds of stars simultaneously over a wide field. The large field is necessary because cool red giants are very rare, as noted above. Although the Kepler field has produced many metal-poor giants, these are not in the remote halo because most are brighter than our magnitude limit and because the line of sight of the Kepler field skims the Galactic plane and does not reach far into the halo. Previous K2 halo fields include very few such faint stars with ugri photometry that indicates a potential cool giant. Consequently, this proposed work is responsive to the K2 solicitation for the halo fields C8 and C10."
GO8028,8,Billy,L,Quarles,SETI Institute,billy.l.quarles@nasa.gov,"Antoci, Victoria; Rowe, Jason Frank",The heat is on: exoplanets that orbit Hot stars,"Science Goals Objectives: The Kepler Mission has discovered a few thousand planet candidates, which has allowed for a statistical determination of planet size and orbital characterization.   In particular, multi-planet systems, where more than one planet is seen transiting a star have provided a wealth of information covering statistical confirmations, eccentricity distributions, mutual inclinations and dynamical stability.  We have learned that not only are planets plentiful, but are found in relatively flat and circular orbits.  However, this knowledge of the architecture exoplanetary systems is only currently valid for cooler G, K and M-dwarf stars, which were the prime targets from the original Kepler Mission.  From the Kepler Q1-Q12 catalogue there are only 116 planet-candidate systems where the host star has an effective temperature greater than 6500 K.  From this already small sample, only 18 have 2 or more known transiting candidates.  In stars with temperatures hotter than ~6500 K the stellar envelope structure and evolution on the main sequence is dominated by radiative transfer, opposed to cooler stars where convection plays an important role.   Misalignments between the planets orbital plane and stellar spin axis have been predominately found for stars with radiative atmospheres, whereas stars with convective envelopes typically show close alignment.  This observation is likely linked to the coupling of convective atmospheres and tidal forces.  As such, we wish to use K2 to determine the occurrence rate and orbital properties of multi-planet systems around hot stars.

Methodology: The Kepler Mission was a planet finding machine!  Our team has extensive knowledge and experience with Kepler photometric data for both transit finding and analysis as well as performing asteroseismic analysis of stars with temperatures greater than 6500 K.  We have selected approximately 400 target stars that fit within our target population and will ask for long-cadence (30 min) observations.  One of the problems of searching for planets around hotter stars is that many are known to pulsate (e.g. dSct and gDor type).  Fortunately, the pulsations can be identified, fitted and removed from a photometric light curves to allow searches for planets to reach low-noise levels.  Our plan is to use detrended photometric data and apply asteroseismic tools to remove stellar phenomena that may affect the data and to then search for transiting planets.  We will then study the properties of the planet-candidates using transit-depths, transit-durations and impact parameter to estimate the eccentricity and mutual inclination distributions, we will also estimate our planet search completeness and compare our measured properties to the properties of planetary systems found around cooler stars.

Relevance to Kepler-GO Program: Using space-based astronomical observations of star fields with K2 we will search for and characterize new planets around hot stars. Our research has the potential to determine whether the properties of the host star, convective or radiative atmospheres, play a role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.  We expect to apply for targets in future observing campaigns to make sure we find ample planetary systems around hot-stars to meet our research goals."

Magnetic activity changes dramatically at the stellar/substellar hydrogen-burning limits, but some ultracool dwarfs are known to flare. We will measure the white light flare rate in well-defined statistical samples as a function of effective temperature, rotation rate, and age. Flares are tied to magnetic reconnection rates and the energy budget. We also aim to detect transiting exoplanets by continuing to monitor each available ultracool dwarf in K2 campaigns; brown dwarfs, gas giants, and even large rocky planets are detectable.

Our goals are to discover pulsating variable stars, as well as eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars with variability produced by rotating spots or flares. We use BV and JHK colors and magnitudes listed in the EPIC catalog to select main-sequence stars with Kepler magnitudes between approximately 8 and 12.5. Our selection of stars in this magnitude range will minimize the number of pixels required, yet the stars will be bright enough for ground-based follow-up observations, including high-resolution spectroscopic observations.  The relative sparseness of these two fields near the South and North Galactic Cap will reduce the occurrence of contamination in the light curves from foreground/background stars sharing the same pixels.  Observations by the Kepler spacecraft have turned out to be ideal for discovery and characterization of main-sequence stars pulsating in radial and nonradial pressure and gravity modes. The long time series and high precision of the photometry have enabled determination of frequencies of modes with periods of order a day (g modes) to a few hours (p and mixed modes), and amplitudes as low as tens of parts per million using long-cadence data (30-min integrations per data point). Analysis of Kepler data has raised a number of questions about the possible pulsation driving mechanisms for gamma Doradus g-mode and delta Scuti p-mode pulsations, and revealed more hybrid star candidates (that show pulsations in both types of modes) than can be explained by present theories.  Kepler data have also been used to study slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars (g-mode pulsators), beta Cephei stars (p-mode pulsators) and their hybrids to test stellar pulsation theory in the presumably simpler case for these hotter stars with smaller inefficient envelope convection zones. The analysis has also revealed a number of apparently non-pulsating stars that lie within the pulsation instability regions established by theory that need to be explained. We expect to increase the numbers of these types of stars available for detailed study, especially for candidates brighter than those found in the original Kepler field. We also expect to discover additional eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars.  Our sample selection is not biased toward known pulsators, and includes enough stars to derive statistics on the occurrence of variability.  We will compare our results with similar surveys of stars in the original Kepler Cygnus-Lyra field, and with surveys of stars in young open clusters for K2 Fields 0, 4, 5, and 7. We will produce a catalog of the candidate variables, eclipsing binaries, and magnetically active stars that we find.  Our budget request will be $75 K for Los Alamos Co-Is only."

For billions of years the Earth's shadow against the Sun has swept a path through space revealing our existence to the stellar neighbors that have passed within 0.26 degrees of the ecliptic.  We propose to survey all GKM dwarf stars within 1.0 degree of the ecliptic using the K2 spacecraft in order to identify transiting planetary systems that can mutually discover Earth via transit observations performed by another civilization in the last ~100,000 yrs.  This survey will significantly expand the number of ecliptic aligned planets known from the two Jupiter-class planets with 0.26 degrees of the current ecliptic (the hot-Jupiter, WASP-47b and the direct imaging, 5 Myr old 1RXS-J160929b) into the regime of Super-Earth size planets.

Methodology:
We will employ our extensive background in the analysis of Kepler data in order to search and provide a catalog of planet candidates from the K2 data within the ecliptic using tools and techniques developed for Kepler.

Uranus and Neptune, with masses less than 18 Earth masses comprise a distinct class from Jupiter and Saturn, with masses greater than 95 Earth masses. The primary constituents of Uranus and Neptune are likely ices surrounding a rocky core with a relatively thin atmospheric veneer of hydrogen rich gas. The Kepler Mission has ably demonstrated that such Neptune and Uranus sized planets are commonmuch more common than gas giants in factoutside of the solar system. It is thus important to understand the interior structure of these worlds in order to better model their formation and evolution. Unfortunately our best data on the interior structure of these worlds comes from the gravitational harmonics measured during the single flybys of Voyager 2 about 25 years ago.  Oscillations not only provide complimentary information but would be more sensitive to internal sharp boundaries.

The two wheel K2 mission will now observe fields along the ecliptic continuously up to 80 days.  K2 presents an opportunity to obtain ultra-high precision, high duty-cycle, integrated disc photometry of the Solar Systems ice giants to search for oscillations. Seismology is by far the most promising technique for constraining the core mass of a giant planet, independent of the uncertainties that plague interior model inversion.

Additional goals include long term (80 day) monitoring of weather and rotation modulation.  Record of ground and based photometry have shown that rotational variability on ice giants can come from rather unexpected sources.  We plan to have a limited set disk-resolved images to help correlate observations from K2 with atmospheric activity.  K2 observations of Neptune have already shown clear 2% variations on time-scales related to the rotation period.  

Methodology: Oscillations of a giant planet change the size of the observable disk, thus altering the total reflected solar flux. From simple geometry alone a velocity of 50 cm/s with a frequency of 1 mHz changes the reflected flux at the several ppm level.   Thus photometry has the potential to detect oscillations excited by turbulence from convection that pumps energy into random sound waves.  Uranus brightness at quadrature is comparable to that of the brightest stars that Kepler has monitored in its exoplanet search with an apparent size ranging from 3.3 to 4.0.  It has been repeatedly shown that Kepler photometry for bright (V<8) stars can reach noise levels of better than 1 ppm in the Fourier domain on time-scales shorter than 30 minutes with a month of observations.  There have been a number of searches for giant planet oscillations, primarily for Jupiter.  Gaulme et al. (2011) reported the Doppler detection of jovian modes with peak amplitudes near frequencies of 1.2 mhz, a period of about 14 minutes.  One of us (MM) carried out an exploratory computation of ice giant mode frequencies some years ago but did not publish the results, but as with Jupiter and Saturn expected periods are in the range of tens to hundreds of minutes. Thus short-cadence is necessary.

Summary: Observations of Uranus (and other giant planets) with Kepler have the potential to answer many long-standing questions regarding the interior structure of ice giants from detecting a core to understanding the compositional structure of the envelope. The clear detection of oscillation modes will of course energize a new generation of theorists to compute model frequencies for comparison with data. We propose that K2 observe Uranus continuously with short and long-cadence photometry."

Due to their diversity in fundamental properties (masses, luminosities, chemical compositions), RGB stars are ideal targets to tackle two key unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of host star mass, and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets. We propose to continue our survey of low-luminosity RGB stars (with radii between ~3.5-8 solar radii) to detect transiting gas-giant planets with K2 and address the above science questions by combining exoplanet transits and asteroseismology.

We have selected ~1400 targets for long-cadence observations using colors, reduced proper motions, and publicly available spectroscopic surveys. Planet candidates will be detected using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since RGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planet candidates.

The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing bright low-luminosity RGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

Space observations of RR Lyrae stars delivered an avalanche of discoveries including new dynamical phenomena that helped to study the internal structure and evolution of horizontal-branch stars. These objects are excellent galactic structure tracers and distance indicators, therefore understanding their dynamics is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. In this proposal we plan to study ~110 RR Lyrae stars in Field 8 and ~230 in Field 10 in long cadence and 5-5 in short cadence mode. The sample will be used to conduct galactic structure studies and to improve our understanding of the pulsational dynamics of RR Lyrae stars.

Research goals. 1. Study the Galactic structure and history by obtaining distances to RR Lyrae stars and determine their spatial distribution (halo streams, over-densities). During the K2 Mission we are building a unique database from field to field covering different parts of our Galaxy, to yield an unprecedented photometric RR Lyrae sample which will form the base of galactic structure studies and near-field cosmology. 2. Statistical analysis of various dynamical phenomena (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko-modulation, period-doubling, low-dimensional chaos, nonradial modes) and their occurrence rates to better understand their origin and their effect on distance determination. This can only be accomplished with K2. 3. Analyze in detail all RR Lyrae light curves, especially overtone and classical double-mode pulsators. The original Kepler field contained no double-mode RR Lyrae stars, and only a few overtone pulsators. In previous fields K2 observed 5 RRd and 24 RRc, but with Fields 8 &10 we will be able to increase their number by a factor of 2 and 3, respectively. This will aid the investigation of dynamical phenomena (resonances, mode interactions) that may be important in other types of pulsating stars, but can be best studied only in large-amplitude stars and with space photometry, and will also help to derive masses for RRd stars.

Methods. We produce light curves from target pixel data (PyKE and own software), then apply corrections, trend-filtering, outlier removal, etc. Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. Metallicities will be derived from empirical relations calibrated with high-resolution Keck/CFHT spectra. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations.
Targets. Approximately 100 and 230 RR Lyrae stars will be proposed (5-5 stars per field for short cadence observations). Although the RR Lyrae stars are faint due to their distances, the majority falling between 15 and 19 mag, where Kepler's precision is still high for these objects. 

Experience of team members. Our team consists of members of the Working Group#7 (RR Lyrae and Cepheids) of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, who have been working on Kepler data (also preparation and target selection) since the launch of the original mission. Our scientists are experts on data reduction, pixel photometry, light curve and time-frequency analysis, as well as theorists performing numerical hydrodynamical modeling. We developed dedicated software and routinely analyze Kepler and K2 data, and published 15+ Kepler RR Lyrae papers in high-impact journals. The group has access to ground-based follow-up (multi- color photometric and spectroscopic) instruments in Taiwan, Korea, USA, Canada and Hungary to complement space-based observations. We are currently finalizing two K2 papers featuring the first unambiguous detection of the Blazhko effect beyond the Magellanic Clouds, and a summary paper on RR Lyrae stars observed in the K2 Engineering Field."
GO8039,8,Andras,,Pal,MTA CsFK,apal@szofi.net,"Sarneczky, Krisztian; Molnar, Laszlo; Kiss, Laszlo; Szabo, Gyula M",K2 photometry of four irregular Uranian satellites,"Regarding to the observational modes and instrumentation constraints, the detection and photometry of moons of outer giant planets highly resemble to those of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) due to their remoteness. As we presented in our recent study (Pal et al. 2015), by involving precise and fine-tuned algorithms the Kepler/K2 mission is indeed capable to perform photometry of TNOs with scientifically relevant quality down to the faint limit of R=23 magnitudes. In addition, we also demonstrated that the essential physical quantities regarding to the rotational characteristics can be resolved using only a few hundreds of pixels like in the case of 2002 GV31 if observation masks are focused at the stationary point of the given object. These physical quantities, including the rotation period, flux amplitude and the presence of a double-peaked light variations can then further constrain the theories of the formation and origin of these objects and hence those of Solar System.

In order to exploit these unique capabilities of the Kepler/K2 mission regarding to Solar System studies, here we propose to observe four members of the outer Uranian satellite system, namely Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero and Setebos. According to former observations, database information and predictions, two out of these objects (Caliban and Sycorax, see the table below) are bright enough to safely observe using our earlier implementations for Kepler/K2 + TNO photometric pipelines. The two another targets (Prospero and Setebos) are predicted to be somewhat fainter than our detections for 2002 GV31. However, the lack of background sources (the Uranian system can be seen throughout Cycle 8 far off from the plane of the Milky way), and the low inclination which yield direct apparent turnbacks instead of a loop (see e.g. the case of 2007 JJ43) could yield optimal masks with a lesser number of pixels. In our proposal, we mark these two fainter targets as ``Priority 2'' since one can only extrapolate that these two can successfully be detected and there is no available confirmation in the literature. Therefore, upon a successful data reduction, rather faint detections of moving objects can also be pushing the limits of the Kepler/K2 mission.

According to the current stage of mission planning regarding to K2/Cycle 8, all of the the proposed targets will fall on silicon. In addition, the saturation trails of Uranus will avoid these moving targets, and even the closest satellite (Caliban) will be outside the expected reflection halos.

In addition, one of these satellites, Sycorax has clearly been detected in far infrared by employing the PACS detector of the Herschel Space Observatory in the framework of the ``TNO's are Cool!'' open time key programme (Lellouch et al. 2013). Therefore, the combination of thermal emission data with the accurate photometric data series reflecting the physical rotation properties of this body can lead to a fairly comprehensive and unique view to this object -- which would be the first such observation in the context of outer irregular satellites.

This unbound, outermost layer of an atmosphere is called its exosphere.  Several observations of extended atmospheres have been made (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Schlawin et al. 2010; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010, 2012; Fossati et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2012; Cauley et al. 2015, submitted) in hydrogen (both ground-state and excited) and various metals.

Our team detected excited, n=2 hydrogen (through hydrogen alpha absorption) in the exosphere of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012), the first such detection in an exoplanet atmosphere.  Follow-up observations (Cauley et al. 2015, submitted) confirmed this result by detecting exospheric absorption in hydrogen alpha, hydrogen beta, and hydrogen gamma, and also observed a significant pre-transit signal in these lines that is consistent with a bow shock leading the planet by several planetary radii.  Jensen et al. (2012) hypothesized that the excited hydrogen in the exosphere may be correlated with chromospheric activity, as HD 189733b, the only planet in that paper's sample of four planets to show H-alpha absorption, was also the most chromospherically active in the sample (as measured by S_HK and log [R'_HK] indices).

We propose to search for planets around stars which are candidates for chromospheric activity in the Kepler Campaign 8 and 10 fields.  The initial (but not exhaustive) basis for our target list is the tens of possible targets in the approximate fields listed in the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Survey's catalogue of chromospherically active stars (Zerjal et al. 2013).  Looking for planets around active stars with radial velocity methods is often disfavored because the stellar noise limits RV precision.  However, this makes the transit method the more important way to detect planets in these cases.  Furthermore, if any of these stars do have a transiting planet, they will be excellent potential candidates for follow-up spectroscopy with the large ground-based telescopes (Keck I, Hobby-Eberly Telescope) that our team has used in the past to detect exospheric absorption.  The goal of follow-up spectroscopic observations would be to search for excited hydrogen absorption from an exosphere, including possible pre-transit signals.  As a secondary science product, many of these active stars will have light curves worth studying on their own for stellar astrophysics purposes."

IC 1613 is an isolated irregular dwarf galaxy within the Local Group. Thanks to its relative proximity (730 kpc), low foreground reddening, and the large number of Cepheid stars in it, it has been the subject of several studies during the past century (see, e.g. Sandage 1971, Bernard et al. 2010, and references therein). It played a key role in the discovery of the different stellar populations and the calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation.  

Although Cepheid stars have been extensively studied in the past, space photometric observations uncovered some new, puzzling details about them. Results from Kepler and MOST showed that significant jitter occurs in the light curve shape and period (Derekas et al. 2012, Evans et al. 2015). Some stars exhibit a low-amplitude additional modes of unknown origin. One mode in particular is strongly linked to the first overtone with a period ratio of ~0.6-0.64, across variable star classes (Moskalik 2014). This mode was first discovered in classical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and later in RR Lyrae stars too. We recently identified the same mode in the K2 observations of first-overtone galactic Cepheids. 

We expect that a significant portion of the IC 1613 sample will be measured accurately enough and long enough (for several pulsation cycles) that we will be able to search for the signs of period jitter and additional modes. The results will then be directly comparable to the K2 observations of Cepheids in the Milky Way. 

Targets

IC 1613 will be observable in its entirety during Campaign 8. It contains about 200 known Cepheids between 19 and 23 magnitudes in V, of which 30 are brighter than 21 magnitudes. The experiences with the faint trans-Neptunian objects (Pál et al. 2015) and with the RR Lyrae stars in the dwarf galaxy Leo IV (Molnár et al., in prep.) indicate that meaningful photometry can be extracted even for targets as faint as 21-23 magnitudes. The brightest stars pulsate with periods comparable with the campaign length (20-40 days), but most stars have periods shorter than 10 days and therefore several consecutive pulsation cycles will be observable. 

Beside the classical Cepheids, a few W Vir stars (Type-II Cepheids) are also known in the galaxy. Furthermore, an extended mosaic covering the area may also allow for extracting additional bright sources to explore other science cases.

Observing strategy and research team

Given the faintness of the targets, we propose to observe all targets in long cadence mode. Cepheids populate IC 1613 quite densely, compared to the resolution of Kepler. Their spatial distribution justifies tiling a large part of the galaxy with a continuous mosaic, instead of individual, potentially overlapping target pixel masks. Image subtraction techniques will be applied to extract the photometry of the faint but strongly variable stars. We will employ the same pipelines that we used to process the TNO and Leo IV targets.

Our team includes members of the KASC RR Lyrae and Cepheid Working Group, and consists of researchers who are experts in pixel photometry and crowded fields, light curve analysis, and hydrodynamic modelling of stellar pulsation. We routinely analyse Kepler and K2 data and have published multiple papers on related topics.

Success will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution. This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the solar neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.

RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.

AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (on average ~5000 per campaign) to probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys structure and evolution from its stellar populations.

METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use our seismic inferred stellar properties to stresstest state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."
GO8045,8,Elme,,Breedt,University of Warwick,E.Breedt@warwick.ac.uk,"Gaensicke, Boris Teddy; Steeghs, Daniel",Accretion disc variability in Cataclysmic Variables,"Accretion discs are a common occurrence in the universe. They exist on physical scales spanning orders of magnitude, ranging from the parsec scale discs which power active galactic nuclei to protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (few thousand km). The flow of material and angular momentum through these discs are governed by the same underlying physical processes, but timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion discs around cataclysmic variables (CVs) are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure and the effects of accretion rate variations, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Continuing our programme from campaigns 0 to 7, we propose to monitor the CVs and X-ray binaries in the K2 fields with the aim of building a library of high quality light curves that can be used to investigate disc-based phenomena. CVs and other accreting compact objects display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days). The unique capability of Kepler/K2 to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is key to understand accretion and accretion variability over such a wide range of timescales."
GO8048,8,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Farihi, Jay; Veras, Dimitri; Cauley, Paul Wilson; Gaensicke, Boris Teddy",A Search for Transiting Objects Orbiting White Dwarf Stars,"Science Goals and Objectives: Given their small size, white dwarf stars present a very intriguing sample to monitor for transiting objects. Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013). The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations. The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]). Given the extreme difficulty of measuring atmospheric properties of Earth-sized planets around solar-like stars, our first biomarker characterization of an Earth-sized planetary atmosphere, may come from an object transiting a white dwarf star. Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015). I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours. Even if no planets are detected for a significant sample of white dwarfs, an interesting constraint can be put on the population of such planets. 

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). 

Methodology: Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total. The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits. Additionally, the first planets detected were around a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992), so it may also be possible for white dwarfs to host planets. Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign. Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence. Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground. While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation. However, a follow-up campaign on known targets is quite straightforward. At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope. However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods. 

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO8049,8,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",Monitoring of Targets Within 100 Light Years,"Science Goals and Objectives: Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 light years provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres. A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets. It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come. I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 light years or 30.7 pc. A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons. This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes. This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques. Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars. While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges. A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable. 

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars). In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored. The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets. 

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability. An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003). One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium. This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint. Long cadence observations would be appropriate. 

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found. These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO8050,8,William,D.,Cochran,The University of Texas at Austin,wdc@astro.as.utexas.edu,"Shporer, Avi; Johnson, Marshall C",Probing the Planetary Population of High-Mass Stars,"Objectives: To date most planet searches have been confined to stars of spectral type F and later, as hotter stars have fewer spectral lines and tend to be rapidly rotating, making precise radial velocity (RV) observations difficult. By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiant stars in this mass range [1], but the masses of these stars have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus a number of planet candidates which are pending validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement subgiant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets and will be able to probe close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the subgiants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars, which currently number seven confirmed planets, too few to allow statistically significant investigations of this population. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2.

Targets: We plan to request approximately 100 long cadence targets, evenly divided between Fields 8 and 10. The sample will consist of A and early F-type dwarfs. We will propose for targets with 8<V<12.5, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: We will process the K2 data and search for planetary transit signals using PyKE. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory; we will leverage our group's experience with similar observations of Kepler prime mission targets. For long-period targets where the K2 observations are insufficient to constrain the transit parameters to the desired precision, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT). Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other techniques. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (an extension of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to rapidly rotating stars, where the spectral line distortion during transit is spectroscopically resolved) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit. We are currently pursuing a program to validate Kepler prime mission candidates using Doppler tomography [5], and will use the same methodology for K2 candidates.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics Program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

A major result from surveys for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars.  This trend is not seen, however, around super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al 2013).  We propose to search a large sample of sub-solar metallicity stars in K2 GO Cycle 3 fields 8 and 10 for transiting planets of all sizes.  Stars in this metallicity range fall into three populations: the thin-disk (which also extends into super-solar metallicity), the thick-disk, and the halo (which extends to extremely metal poor stars). These three populations differ both kinematically and chemically.  Thick disk stars exhibit a larger vertical scale height in the galactic orbits, and they also show alpha-capture element abundances enhanced by about a factor of two over thin-disk stars.  Halo stars show even more extreme kinematics and also exhibit significant enhancement of alpha-capture elements.  The discovery of the Kepler-444 system (Campante et al 2015), which comprises five sub-Earth size planets orbiting an ancient (11.2 Gy age) thick-disk star with significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe=H]=-0.69 +/- 0.09 dex) shows that planet formation started very early in the history of the galaxy.  We will compute planet occurrence rates for stars as a function of stellar metallicity, stellar population and of planet radius.  For stellar metallicity, we will consider not just the standard [Fe/H] abundance, but also the abundance of the very important alpha-capture elements.  The goal of our program is to determine the characteristics of the first stars in our Galaxy to form potentially habitable planetary systems.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W. Cochran) and at KASI (led by Dr.  B.-C. Lee) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.  and will perform Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.

Targets:
We will propose a large sample of approximately 2000 targets.  Stellar metallicities range from [Fe/H]=-1.2 to solar. The stars range in V magnitude from 5.7 to 12.6, with most of the targets in the range 10 < V < 12. Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2015, MNRAS, 247, 2880) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 80 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems. These results will provide important new constraints on the physics and chemistry of planetary system formation, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."

Variability in the optical is observed at the 10% level in 99% of quasars. The cause of quasar variability is not known, but current theories suggest that the variations may be attributable to a combination of small-scale variations in the accretion disk viscosity that are triggered by localized dynamo processes, accretion disk instabilities, large scale fueling-rate variations, and complex oscillations of the accretion disk. Optical variability may be driven by X-ray variability which itself may be generated by flares in the accretion disk. Physical mechanisms for variability introduce causal correlation into the light curves of quasars i.e. it may be possible to probe the physical drivers of quasar variability by studying the correlation structure of their light curves.

One of the challenges in understanding the physics of quasar variability is that, while one can compute an average quasar spectral energy distribution, there is no ""standard"" quasar.  The diversity of quasars is seen not only in the range of their radio and X-ray properties, but also in their UV emission lines.  Exploring that diversity is the focus of this work and requires stacking analysis of a large number of faint, but luminous quasars at relatively high redshifts.

This diversity of UV emission-line properties in quasars can be characterized as considering broad emission line flux as having two origins with different relative contributions in each quasar: 1) a virialized component, and 2) a non-virial component, likely from radiatively-driven accretion-disk winds (Leighly 2004; Richards et al. 2011).  A key facet of such two-component models is that more luminous quasars are more likely to have a strong wind component (Murray et al. 1995; Proga 2000, 2003; Everett 2005).  This can be seen empirically in the emission line properties of quasars. 

Using these diagnostics, our group has recently demonstrated a bias in variability-based black hole mass estimates.  Black hole (BH) masses estimated from single-epoch spectroscopy underlie our understanding of the build-up of BHs from high redshift to the present, but are currently based on a small sample of low-L, low-z ""reverberation mapped"" (RM) AGNs (e.g., Kaspi et al. 2000; Vestergaard & Peterson 2006). We found that the existing sample of RM AGNs appears to be biased against quasars where a radiation line driven disk-wind dominates the broad emission line region (BELR).  Similar biases are expected to exist in the current Kepler/K2 sample.

Without a better understanding of differences in quasar variability across the diversity of quasar emission line properties, we will not be able to fully understand the physics of quasar variability.  To address this problem, we propose to observe 975 known (and candidate) luminous quasars with a mean redshift of z~1.5 -- such objects are far more likely to host winds than the typical AGNs studied by Kepler/K2 to date.  Stacking analysis of the quasars as a function of their known intrinsic properties will allow us to overcome the relatively short timescale of the K2 observing campaigns and will enable us to distinguish differences in the variability of quasars with and without strong winds.	Crucially 166 of our targets are in the so-called SDSS Stripe 82 area and already have up to 100 epochs of data over the course of 8 years.  The combination of these data with new K2 data would be an incredibly powerful tool for AGN variability analysis."

The K2 science mission, with its long baseline, high cadence, high precision and multi-targeting capabilities provides a unique opportunity to examine a broad range of such variables and transients.

Perets et al. 2010 found a new class of faint events (Mv > -16) that were spectroscopically similar to SN Ib/c but have strong calcium lines in their nebular spectra. These objects, characterized by a relatively fast light curve (12 - 15 days to peak brightness),  are difficult to find by traditional surveys, and thus the progenitors of these interesting events are unknown.  In addition, Drout et al. 2014, using the Pan-STARRS1 survey, found a few transients that were relatively bright (-20 < Mv < -16) but with a time to maximum of only a few days. Even though they are bright, their short time scale, some brightening in only a day, causes these events to usually be missed. The stellar origin of these events is also unknown.

This program will be very sensitive to LBV- and nova-like eruptions, large amplitude flare stars, cataclysmic variable stars, and other still unknown types of faint, fast transients.

We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort (along with the main KEGS survey) to observe these galaxies every other day using SkyMapper and ATLAS Pathfinder. We will also coordinate multi- color photometry and spectra to classify the transients using PESSTO, and existing programs at Siding Spring, Lick, Gemini, and Keck."
GO8054,8,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,bod21@cam.ac.uk,"Queloz, Didier Patrick; Gillon, Michael; Huber, Daniel",Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types from M6 to L5, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such an exoplanet has not been discovered yet. As of today, K2 is the only facility that provides the required stability and photometric precision to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0 through 7 observations.

SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.

High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).

RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.

METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 8 and 10, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series. The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on the K2 C0-C2 data and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program.

EXPECTED YIELD. Our target list encompasses 86 targets in total for both campaigns.

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."

Due to the satellite's orbit, TESS will only be able to find potentially habitable worlds around the lowest mass M dwarfs (M < 0.3 Msun). To fully understand the planets around these M dwarfs, it is paramount to accurately characterize their host stars (i.e., determine their mass, radius, effective temperature, and metallicity). We propose to obtain K2 long-cadence data of four (4) known eclipsing binaries with an F or G-dwarf primary star and an M dwarf secondary star.  A full analysis of these unequal mass binaries allows for spectroscopic derivation of the temperature and metallicity of the primary star, and consequently the derivation of the mass and radius for both stellar components and the M-dwarf temperature.  K2 is the only means to acquire the full light curve for these objects, and its extremely high precision photometry allows for tight constraints on the radii of both components and more importantly the detection of the shallow secondary eclipses from which the secondary temperature is derived. Our measurements of the physical properties of the M dwarfs will better calibrate empirical and theoretical relationships at the bottom of the main sequence ultimately providing the best characterization of potentially habitable worlds discovered by TESS."

These deep transits also increase the potential for subsequent atmospheric characterization. The extended Kepler K2 mission provides the opportunity to monitor tens-of-thousands of nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise, long-cadence photometry and discover a new population of rocky and potentially habitable planets and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit spectroscopy. We propose to observe several thousand additional M dwarfs in the K2 campaign 8 and 10 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate hundreds of small planets around M dwarfs from the full K2-MDP program. This new population of planets will drastically increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems, improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected from the SUPERBLINK proper-motion database on the basis of high proper-motion and photometric colors. This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs within 100pc of the Sun from this deep (95% complete to V =19) catalog with little contamination. Our targets have median brightness Kp<16, most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC. We prioritize our targets using expected transit S/N, determined by comparing K2s photometric precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting super-Earth. We estimate transit depths by converting DSS, PanSTARRS 1, 2MASS, and WISE photometry to spectral type and then to radius and temperature. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date. The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward these goals and draws on considerable experience from Kepler. We have so far had successful target proposals in all previous K2 fields, have been awarded a 70-night ESO Large Program for spectroscopic follow-up of candidate planet hosts (PID 194.C-0443) along with dozens of nights of high-precision AO and RV followup at Lick, Palomar, LBT, and Keck.

Relevance: 
The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims to exploit the strengths of the K2 mission design to reveal hundreds of small planets around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-like planets and planets suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky planets and key transit spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) leading up to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; well before the launch of TESS.

We plan to observe a sample of wide binaries spread across the K2 fields to constrain the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence and to provide benchmark systems for gyrochronology.

Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence. Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013).  In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star. Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity. Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars. 


Science Goal 2: Provide benchmark gyrochronology systems. Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components. 


By including wide binary components as Kepler targets, we will produce a valuable legacy product to test and recalibrate gyrochronology relations allowing the ages of field stars to be better constrained.

Target Selection. We will use the proper motion catalogue produced by Kraus et al. (2014) based on the methods of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007) including proper motions, estimated spectral types and distance moduli from SED fitting. We will select objects in both Fields 8 and 10 with significant (>5sigma) proper motions above 30mas/yr. From these we will select pairs of widely separated objects with common proper motion and distance.  To remove contamination due to coincident pairings of unrelated field stars, we will plot a histogram similar to the one we constructed for field 6 of pair separation. From this we will select pairs which lie in the region dominated by true physical pairs."
GO8060,8,David,Robert,Anderson,Keele University,d.r.anderson@keele.ac.uk,"Hellier, Coel; Southworth, John","Short-cadence lightcurves of WASP-107 and WASP-118: a sub-Saturn transiting a spotted star, and a hot Jupiter","For planets that transit across their host stars, we can use spectroscopy and photometry to measure planetary mass and radius. This leads to constraints on the planets' bulk compositions, internal structures, and formation and evolution histories. We recently discovered two transiting planet systems, WASP-107 and WASP-118, which will be on silicon during K2 campaigns 10 and 8, respectively. 

WASP-107b is a warm Saturn in a 5.7-day orbit around a K6 star and WASP-118b is a hot Jupiter in a 4.0-day orbit around an F6 star. Both stars are bright (V~11) and so are good targets for further study; indeed only 18 (13) Kepler exoplanet host stars are brighter than WASP-107 (WASP-118). As accurate and precise stellar and planetary dimensions require well-sampled transit lightcurves, we request short-cadence (SC) data. We have our own software proven capable of processing and analysing the data. 

It would be particularly interesting to know the bulk composition of WASP-107b. 
With a mass 2.2 times that of Neptune and 0.40 times that of Saturn, but a radius 0.94 times that of Jupiter, WASP-107b is in the transition region between ice giants and gas giants. This sets a lower limit on the planetary mass above which large gaseous envelopes can be accreted and retained by proto-planets on their way to becoming gas giants. WASP-107b will prove useful to planetary formation theory, which faces the challenge of explaining how ice giants avoid the runaway gas accretion that otherwise would have turned them into gas giants. 

By measuring the wavelengths of star-light preferentially scattered and absorbed by a transiting planet's atmosphere (transmission spectroscopy), we can infer the atmosphere's composition, and thus the planet's formation and evolution history. Due to the brightness of the host stars and the distended natures of the planetary atmospheres, both WASP-107 and WASP-118 are good targets for transmission spectroscopy.

Giant planets in few-day orbits, or 'hot Jupiters', are thought to have formed farther out and then migrated inwards. The pathway(s) via which hot Jupiters migrate are poorly understood, though we can rectify this by measuring the orbital obliquities of a range of systems. 

We will measure the sky-projected obliquity of WASP-118b with awarded spectroscopy time. With SC K2 data we will determine the inclination of the stellar spin axis and thus the orbital obliquity in three dimensions. WASP-107 rotates too slowly to measure obliquity via spectroscopy, but we are afforded an alternative opportunity due to the spottiness of the star. Its spottiness is evidenced by the periodic modulation of the WASP survey lightcurve and a spot-crossing event in a follow-up lightcurve. By measuring the times at which star spots are occulted by the planet over multiple transits, for which SC data are mandatory, we can infer the obliquity of the planet's orbit."
GO8063,8,Tabetha,Suzanne,Boyajian,Yale University,tabetha.boyajian@yale.edu,"Silva Aguirre, Victor; Creevey, Orlagh; Huber, Daniel; White, Timothy R",Testing asteroseismology with bright red giants using C8 and C10 K2 timeseries and interferometry,"We propose to observe bright red giants stars in long cadence mode in the K2 campaign fields 8 and 10, where interferometric and high-resolution spectroscopic supporting observations will allow us to address several exciting science questions pertaining to 1) asteroseismic scaling relations, 2) chemical mixing processes in stellar interiors, and 3) the abundance of helium. 
	Widely used in the asteroseismology of red giants, asteroseismic scaling relations connect stellar properties such as masses and radii to easy-to-derive seismic parameters such as the frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation. Although scaling relations do have some theoretical justification, they are still mostly based on the only star whose parameters we truly know: the Sun. The precise seismic K2 observations coupled with high-quality ground-based interferometric and spectroscopic data of bright nearby giants will allow us to subject the scaling relations to the most demanding tests. 
	The second application is to constrain the poorly understood mixing processes working inside red giants, such as thermohaline mixing, rotation, and deep circulation. These processes are predicted to have different impact at different stages of red giant evolution, and to leave imprints in the surface chemical composition of a star. Precise seismic log (g) from K2 time series, coupled with high resolution spectroscopy, will allow for a detailed abundance determination of a large number of chemical species. The correlations between elements (e.g. [C/ Fe] vs [N/ Fe]) and departure from their theoretically predicted values (as in the case of Li or 12 C/13 C) are tracers of internal mixing processes, and will be studied as a function of the seismically determined mass. 
	The third goal of this proposal is to address one of the biggest uncertainties in stellar astrophysics: the abundance of helium in stars. The helium second ionization zone inside a star produces an abrupt change in the local sound speed, which is detectable in the Fourier spectrum of time series as a periodic variation. We will construct detailed models of red giants where this variation is detected, and coupled with independent constraints on angular diameter and detailed surface composition, we will put stringent constraints on the helium abundance of red giants and test our assumptions on enrichment laws of the Galaxy. 
	We have selected ~40 bright (Kp~5-8) red giants which are ideally suited for this project due to their precisely determined distances, large angular sizes for interferometry, and detectable oscillations in the 80 day K2 baseline. Red giants observed by Kepler were generally too faint to meet these criteria, making K2 uniquely suited to perform these observations. Our proposal addresses compelling questions in stellar structure and evolution, and is hence directly related to the K2 GO solicitation."

We request further K2 monitoring of new X-ray sources in the Campaigns 8 and 10 fields discovered with our ongoing Kepler-Swift Active Galaxies Survey (KSwAGS) to probe accretion onto compact objects at a variety of scales. The first phase of the KSwAGS survey uncovered 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., in preparation). Approximately half of these sources were indeed active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various types (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring M-stars). High precision optical follow-up would be scientifically useful for all sources; however, the fourth Kepler reaction wheel failed before we could propose Kepler monitoring of the new X-ray targets. We successfully received time for K2 to monitor KSwAGS sources in Field 4, and are awaiting the data currently. This proposal is therefore the second in our rolling plan to survey K2 Fields with Swift, and follow up with K2 optical monitoring.

Previous AGN in the original Kepler field were selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012). These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 108 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum is dominated by starlight rather than AGN light (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2012). Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be constrained by a 75-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks. This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk). This further monitoring will critically enhance the sample numbers of K2-monitored AGN discovered using a relatively unbiased selection method.

Methodology
We aim to use Keplers unprecedented photometric precision to detect characteristic variability timescales using Fourier analysis, which is far superior to the structure function analysis that must be used on ground-based light curves. These timescales are the only possible direct observables of AGN accretion physics, which remains an important astrophysical mystery.  Additionally, these X-ray selected targets will fill in the phase-space of black hole mass and accretion rate, complementing our work in the original Kepler field.


Relevance of Proposed Research
Our KSwAGS project has been assigned high priority status by the Swift team, and should begin surveying 1 module each in the K2 Campaigns 8 and 10 FOVs in July 2015. We anticipate ~50 sources based on the detection rate in previous KSwAGS fields. The photometric precision of K2 will be more than adequate for our scientific purposes."
GO8066,8,Avi,M,Mandell,NASA GSFC,Avi.Mandell@nasa.gov,"Morris, Brett M; Huitson, Catherine; Angerhausen, Daniel",Catch K2-Twos: Finding the Best Planets for Ground-Based Follow Up Spectrophotometry,"Studying extrasolar planets is one of the major frontiers of astronomy today.  The field has transformed from simple identification to comprehensive categorization and characterization of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems. Analyses of data provided by the NASA's Kepler mission has revolutionized this field by compiling a statistically significant number of transiting planets and planetary candidates, providing  time series data for a large sample of systems that can be utilized in consistent comparative studies (e.g. Angerhausen et al., 2015).

One promising new way to further characterize some of these transiting systems are methods using ground-based multi-object spectrographs for transit and eclipse spectrophotometry such as GMOS in the optical (e.g. Stevenson et al., 2014; Huitson et al., 2015, in prep.) or MOSFIRE in the infrared (e.g. Crossfield et al., 2013; Morris et al, 2015, subm.).  These emerging ground-based methods allow access to larger apertures and better time-sampling of transit lightcurves than equivalent HST methods. They therefore have the potential to observe transits at the precisions achievable from space but at a fraction of the cost and with the possibility of repeated measurements in wavelength bands not available from space until the start of JWST. 

However, most of the planets found by the Kepler telescope have host stars that are too faint to be followed up with spectrophotometric techniques even with space based platforms such as Hubble or Spitzer. The ground-based methods are even further constrained by the need for similarly bright comparison stars in close neighborhood to the observed host star of the transiting system. In order to reduce instrumental systematics and optimize the time-sampling needed for transit atmosphere observations, the comparison stars must be bright, of similar magnitude to the exoplanet host star and be within a few arcmin.

To identify ideal candidates for ground-based characterization studies, we therefore we propose to use the single, visible wavelength instrument on board of K2 to obtain high-precision long cadence photometry on of the best suited 500 pairs of similarly bright stars (mag < 12, separation < 5 arcmin). Assuming an occurrence of well-vetted planet candidates with P d 30 d of about ~2%, we expect to find ~20 systems that will be accessible for spectrophotometric follow up from the ground.

The goal of high precision time resolved photometry is to reduce or in the best case remove all noise to achieve photon-noise limited photometry. After years of experience with these data a number of best practices for their handling have emerged: For the reduction and preparation of K2 data as well as for the planet search in the reduced data, we have access to a number of standard procedures that are already widely used in the community (e.g. the PyKe tools,  Barclay & Still 2012;  K2 specific best practices, Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015; or SIP, Angus et al. 2015).  

Finding these extremely valuable targets will enable us to do exactly the kind of basic research that advances our knowledge by characterization of planets and planetary systems outside of our Solar System in order to determine their compositions, dynamics, energetics, and chemical behaviors. The proposed study will directly support NASAs goal to Discover and study planets around other stars, in order to understand the underlying physical processes of exoplanets and to improve understanding of their origins."

We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2 and conducting follow-up high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models. 

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date (Fields 0-7) is small. 

We propose a ranked list of 8023 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We will search for all V < 12 stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 8 and 10, which are accessible to HARPS-N. We will then use the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. 

We will identify promising planet candidates in K2 photometry using the planet detection pipeline developed by team members Vanderburg and Johnson. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities. 

The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 80 nights per year of guaranteed time per year. The follow-up of small planets from Kepler and K2 is the top scientific priority of HARPS-N. PI D. Charbonneau is chair of the HARPS-N Science Team and the Target Selection Team. 

We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves, reconnaissance imaging, and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. 

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a tremendous impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful background information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."

The Sgr stream is a well-studied tidal debris structure that wraps around the entire Milky Way and is detected in many different stellar populations (from main sequence to M and K giant stars). The nearest sections of the stream visible in Field 8 span a range of distances from 10-30 kpc, closer than satellite galaxies around the Milky Way but still many times the distance of the farthest known transiting exoplanets. Even at these distances, K2 will be able to easily observe giant stars.

We have developed a method for exoplanet transit search using K2 data that resulted in the publication of the first systematic catalog of transit candidates based on a K2 data release. This method can robustly detect transiting exoplanets despite the large systematic variability introduced by the diminished pointing precision of the Kepler spacecraft and it is reasonably complete to faint apparent magnitudes (Kp ~ 17-18 mag).

We propose to target the brightest (~100) Sgr stream member stars in Campaign 8 of the K2 Mission and, using our transit detection procedure, search the light curves for large planets transiting these giant stars. These signals will be small and the light curves will be noisy, therefore robust noise modeling will be crucial for transit signal discovery. While the chance of discovering a transiting planet belonging to the Sgr stream is low, the cost is low and the discovery of even a single transiting planet of extragalactic origin would be exciting."

We propose a Large K2 Program to monitor ~2000 bright (r < 18 mag, z < 0.1) galaxies in Campaign 8 and ~2600 in Campaign 10 which should yield 12 - 24 great light curves (LCs) of supernovae. To date, we have identified 6 supernovae in Kepler GO programs (3 Type Ia and 3 Type II, although one may be Type IIn/Ia-csm), and we also found that ~ 4% of our galaxies display AGN activity (Shaya et al 2015) (variable at > 0.001% level). We plan to: a) determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe using features in the early breakout (t < 4 days) LCs; b) explore the explosion physics of SN, especially SN Ia, using subtle features during their rise (t < 20 days); c) improve the calibration of SN Ia as standard candles for measuring distances, Ho, and dark energy using K2 LCs of unprecedented detail; d) in nearby galaxies, look for fast (t < 10 day) and faint (Mv > -15) transients in a new range of parameter space provided by K2; and e) add significant knowledge to the virtually unexplored very low-Eddington regime of AGN. 

There is an ongoing controversy over the basic physics of one of the key tools in cosmology, the SN Ia standard candle. Do SNe Ia gradually reach critical mass via accretion from a companion star or does it merge with another WD? If a white dwarf had been accreting mass from a companion star, as the ejecta reaches the companion a shock would form with observable optical emission (Kasen 2010). The emission would be short lived and strongest from certain viewing angles, requiring rapid cadence for several SNe before definitive conclusions can be reached. For the 3 SN Ia discovered by Kepler monitoring of ~500 galaxies (Olling et al. 2015), no companions were indicated and tight constraints were placed. With a larger sample, we could determine the statistics for the two possible channels that trigger SN Ia. Meanwhile, features due to the different explosion physics (detonation, deflagration, inwards-moving diffusion waves, etc) of Ia and core collapse SNe will also be revealed. K2 will allow for the first time to test models more complicated than simple ""expanding fireballs."" 

Our program will improve the calibration of SN Ia's for distance measurements. By determining correlations among the key parameters needed for distance fitting (light-curve width, maximum, and the explosion time) on the scale of minutes rather than days, this program will improve the precision of distances and hence the values of Ho and dark energy as a function of redshift. 

We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe the entire field every other day using SkyMapper and ATLAS Pathfinder. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify discovered transients using PESSTO, and existing programs at Siding Spring, Lick, Gemini, and Keck. These data, coupled with high precision 30 minute K2 data will have enormous legacy value. 

In addition this program will also be sensitive to LBV- and nova-like eruptions, tidal shredding of stars or other material by super-massive black holes, and other still unknown types of faint, fast transients in the nearer galaxies of our sample. 

Methods: 
We are exploring techniques to detrend sensitivity changes over the short (daily) and long terms (months). We use correlations of brightness with centroid position and width similar to the kepsff tool of the Pyke Software suite and are creating Cotrending Basis Vectors based on our target galaxies. Both methods can be applied to the quiet time before a SN event and then extrapolated passed the onset. For AGN, we use the minimum number of CBVs that eliminate the instrumental noise but leave physical variations intact.

E.",New Algol Candidates for Investigating Gas Stream Dynamics in Interacting Binary Systems,"The K2 mission and the modeling capabilities of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary system analysis program present a unique opportunity to probe gas stream dynamics and/or magnetic activity from the recently discovered brightness variations in Algol binaries that we call L/T (Leading/Trailing hemisphere) variables. The L/T phenomenon was discovered in Kepler data and has never been reported in ground-based photometry. L/T behavior is likely due to changes in either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the impact site's location and movement can be diagnostic of stream dynamics that may be modulated by magnetic fields. In the cool spot scenario the variability is a consequence of magnetic activity on the mass loser. We propose K2 observations in the LC mode of 10 Algol systems in Fields 8 and 10 to expand our study of mass transfer dynamics and the importance of magnetic fields.  In K2 Cycle 3 we are extending our study to close eclipsing systems with periods less than 1.0  day to investigate whether enhanced tidal interaction has influence on the L/T ratio and behavior. The Kepler and K2 databases are deficient in observations of very short-period Algols.  Modeling the K2 light curves with the WD program, stellar and spot parameters, including spot motions, will be determined so as to generate a virtual image of the binary versus time. This project will yield information on the detailed physics of mass transfer, especially the roles of accretion hot spots and magnetic fields. The updated WD program will be made available for future applications by others working with the Kepler/K2  databases."
GO8075,8,Csaba,,Kiss,Konkoly Observatory,pkisscs@konkoly.hu,"Szabo, Gyula M; Molnar, Laszlo; Pal, Andras; Szabo, Robert",Rotational properties of selected transneptunian objects in the Kepler K2 C8 & C10 campaigns,"The light curves of transneptunian objects (TNOs) hold information on the formation and evolution of the small bodies in the Solar System, as it is outlined in our White Paper, presented to the GO Office in the early phase of the K2 mission. Our recent study of the TNOs 2002 GV31 and 2007 JJ43 has shown (Pal et al., 2015) that the Kepler K2 mission can be very effectively used for TNO light curve observations. Here we propose to study light curves of a selected set of TNOs in the K2 C8 and C10 campaigns with an optimised observing strategy. 

A part of our targets have available thermal infrared data from Herschel Space Observatory measurements (Müller et al., 2009), with accurate size and geometric albedo values. This is important in resolving the size and absolute albedo ambiguity of the light cur e inversion techniques (Kaasalainen et al. 2001). These methods are able to reconstruct the shape and/or the surface albedo variegations based on the observed visual range light curve, however, the same shape and/or relative albedo distribution can be produced by objects of different size and median albedo combinations. With the synergy of Herschel and Kepler K2 light curve observations we will be able to obtain a comprehensive picture of these objects. 

The other set of objects in our proposed study are TNOs in mean motion resonance 
with Neptune. Resonant objects are extremely valuable since these objects were likely captured into these resonances during the outward migration of Neptune. Physical characteristics of these objects can constrain evolutionary scenarios of the Solar System as different resonances swept up or captured objects from different initial locations. The rotational characteristics are one of these important constraints. 

The first trans-Neptunian objects in the K2 mission have been observed with long, thin pixel mosaics covering the entire arc of the orbit around the stationary point. 
While this method undoubtedly provides the largest amount of data from a single 
target, it is not the most optimal in terms of pixel budget per target. Targets farther from the stationary points the exhibit quadratically increasing proper motions leading to excessive pixel requirements. About 7000 pixels were used in Campaign 2 to cover the path of 2007 JJ43, yet a small gap around the stationary point meant that 21 days of data were still lost. In contrast, 2002 GV31 was observable for 16 days during Campaign 1 with a single mask that contained only 500 pixels. We propose to maximize the scientific return of the K2 TNO program by allocating smaller masks (1500-1800 pixels) for multiple targets per campaign. The positive detection of 2002 GV31 indicates that 20-30 day-long observations around the stationary point may allow us to reliably determine the rotation periods and amplitudes of targets as faint as 23 magnitudes. Pixel masks can be further optimized if they are not centered on the stationary point which is the westernmost point of their proper motion during the observing run, but shifted slightly towards east (by 5-10 pixels).

The first of our three objectives is construct catalogs of transiting planets in the magnitude-limited samples of K2 fields.  These catalogs enable diverse follow-up observations and analyses by our team and others.  Second, we aim to discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  Our third goal is to use the planet catalogs to measure variations in the occurrence rate of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood. We already see differences between the populations of planets orbiting nearby stars and stars in the prime Kepler Field.  For example, hot Jupiters are 2.5 times less abundant in the Kepler Field (Howard et al. 2012).  We have to wonder if the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone (Petigura et al. 2013) is similarly reduced relative to nearby stars. With this proposal we will measure the occurrence of detectable, short-period super-Earths and Neptune-size planets (~2-3 Earth-radii). 


This Cycle 3 request for Campaigns 8 and 10 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in C0-C7 (PIs Howard, Sanchis-Ojeda, Petigura, and Winn) that constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.  We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts.  Here we request magnitude-limited samples (Kp < 14) of Fields 8 and 10 comprising 8971 and 8443 stars, respectively.

We will continue our search for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013).  We catalog the planets discovered, their orbital and physical properties, and their host star characteristics.  We compute the occurrence rates of small, close-in planets using injection-and-recovery tests to account for the sensitivity of TERRA and will report the field-to-field variability and overall rates of planet occurrence. Assuming a precision of 80 ppm over 6.5 hours, a 2 Earth-radii planet with P = 20-day is detectable at SNR = 8 during a single 75-day K2 campaign.  Based on the prime mission occurrence statistics, we expect to find 3 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with P < 20 days per 1,000 stars observed. As validated by our searches of K2 photometry from Campaigns 0-2, a sample of 8,000 stars is expected to yield ~25 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with orbital periods less than 20 days, providing an occurrence measurement with 25% fractional uncertainty. With 8,000 stars, we will be sensitive to factor-of-two variations in the occurrence rate of 2-3 Earth-radii planets at 4-sigma significance.  In addition, we will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES and other facilities. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultra-short-period Earths. Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission.

This proposal directly addresses two objectives from the prime Kepler mission: measuring planet occurrence rates and characterizing small planets with Doppler mass measurements."

We propose the characterization of Be stars in K2 fields 8 and 10. Classical Be stars are rapid rotators of spectral type B and luminosity class V-III which have an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk. The disk often exhibits Balmer emission lines and an infrared excess fed by discrete mass loss events called outbursts. In spite of their high V sin i, rapid rotation alone cannot explain the ejection episodes as most Be stars do not rotate at their critical rotation rates. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations have been analyzed to demonstrate short-term variations are rather common among early-type Be stars. The observed line profile variability (LPV) is characterized by moving bumps traveling from blue to red across the line profile on timescales ranging from minutes to a few days. Non-radial pulsations (NRP) have been proposed as an explanation of the LPV observed in hot stars. NRP produce LPV thanks to the combination of the Doppler displacement of stellar surface elements with their associated temperature variations due to the compression/expansion caused by the passage of waves through the photosphere. NRP could be the additional mechanism required for a rapidly rotating B star to become a Be star, that is to trigger the Be phenomenon by means of mass ejection (Rivinius et al. 1998).

2. High-precision photometry and pulsation periods
Huat et al. (2009) found for the Be HD 49330 from CoRoT and ground-based spectroscopic data an increase in amplitude for g-modes and a decrease for p-modes just before an outburst. Neiner et al. (2012) discovered gravito-inertial modes in the Be star HD 51452. They found that the mode amplitudes were linked to the presence of mini outbursts. In general, hot Be stars display nonradial pressure pulsation modes, whereas cooler ones display gravity modes. Despite those empirical evidences, the physical processes responsible for the outbursts and mass loss in Be stars are still poorly understood. Dziembowski et al. (2007) showed that high-order g-modes driven by the kappa mechanism are unstable in the region of the HR diagram occupied by Be stars. The predicted radial velocity amplitude due to an l=3 g-mode is ~ 20 km/s for a star with 4 solar masses, with pulsation periods in the range ~0.51.1 days. For more massive and hotter stars like HD 171219, unstable modes are found with periods of 0.5-2 days.

3. Methods and proposed targets
Pulsation analysis of a star requires the measurement of frequencies with both high photometric precision and high time-frequency resolution. Only space missions provide both conditions. Stellar seismology made a great leap forward thanks to the MOST, CoRoT and Kepler satellites. We have selected stars with spectral type between A0 and late-O in the K2 fields 8 and 10.  Our targets have Kp between 5.6 and 16.1 Long cadence (30 min) is desirable for this research. We aim to have both Kepler photometric time-series and simultaneous ground spectroscopic observations to measure Be periodicities and understand the Be phenomenon. Our proposal fits the Small category, and the number of our targets will be under 100. Our group have experience with asteroseismology and have already worked in the same analysis with CoRoT data.

4. Significance
Be stars, as easy-to-observe objects giving a privileged peek into the structure of rapidly rotating stars, are therefore among the best suited laboratories to investigate important problems in contemporary astrophysics, like the effects of rapid rotation on stellar evolution.

GO9901,9,Peter,,Garnavich,Notre Dame,,,Studying the Intermediate Polar 1RXSJ180431.1--273932,"We request Director’s Discretionary time so that K2 can study the new intermediate polar (IP) 1RXSJ180431.1-273932 during Campaign 9 (microlensing field). An IP is a cataclysmic variable where the magnetic white dwarf is accreting from a companion star and the spin of the primary is not synchronized with the orbital period.

The X-ray source 1RXSJ180431.1-273932 (hereafter RX1804) was first discovered as a ROSAT bright source (Voges et al. 1999) and later observed in more detail with XMM-Newton (Nucita et al. 2007). The latter authors identified the optical source near the X-ray position with a red giant of spectral type M6III and found an X-ray periodicity of 494 seconds. This led to the idea that this source was a possible rare symbiotic X-ray binary with a red giant accreting onto a neutron star. However, optical imaging and spectroscopy by Masetti et al. (2012) provided a better picture of the X-ray error circle and they found a candidate closer to the center with a V magnitude of about 17.3. Spectra showed Balmer emission lines as well as strong high excitation HeII 468.6 nm emission. This spectrum, along with the X-ray flux is indicative of a magnetic white dwarf accreting from a low mass companion. The observed X-ray period would be compatible with the spin period of the white dwarf, making this object an intermediate polar (IP). Besides the spin period, Masetti et al. (2012) and Nucita et al. (2007) both found a decrease in the Xray count rate throughout the XMM observation, as well as variability on a timescale of hours.

Kepler and K2 data are only available for one IP so far (FO Aqr) from field 3 of K2. Our analysis of the spin period of FO Aqr shows a rich power-spectrum of the spin period beating against the orbital period and many harmonics. There is variation in pulse shape that can be attributed to the changing accretion curtain geometry over the orbital period. Analysis of the 494 sec spin period of RX1804 over the baseline of the K2-9 field can provide the information that is needed to confirm this source as a IP (if the spin period remains constant over the 2 months) and to determine a possible cause of the X-ray decline and variability (is it due to a periodic orbital modulation or to large sporadic changes in the accretion rate of the system). We request fast cadence (1 minute) observations if possible."
GO9902,9,Gavin,,Ramsay,Armagh Observatory,,,Symbiotic Stars in the Campaign 9 field,"We have identified ten symbiotic binaries in the SIMBAD database which are 'on-silicon' in the K2 Campaign 9 field (Table 1). They are bright (KepMag∼8–14) and half have known (or approximate) orbital periods. Given the sharp drop in the K2 response at ∼4200 A, we do not expect to detect evidence of flickering or short periods since this is only visible at U and B bands. We therefore bid for long cadence observations of our ten targets. 

What do we expect to obtain from these observations? Detecting evidence for the pulsation period of the red giant star in symbiotics is notoriously difficult. With a base line of ∼70 days with K2 we will search for a approximately week or month long variability in the light curves which could provide evidence for a pulsation period in the red giant star. Outbursts have also been seen in a number symbiotics (eg Z And, Sokoloski et al 2006 ApJ 636 1002 and Figure 2, AG Dra Munari et al 2009 PASP 121 1070) as have eclipses (eg BF Cyg Skopal et al 1997 MNRAS 292 703) which would give excellent means to determine the binary parameters. Although the likelihood of detecting either an outburst or an eclipse is fairly small, K2 observations of either event in the ten targets would provide an excellent opportunity to explore outbursts in symbiotic stars and accreting binary systems in general."
GO9903,9,Ehsan,,Moravveji,KU Leuven,,,UPBEAT: Unravelling Pulsations of BluE supergiAnTs,"Blue supergiant (BSG) stars are scarce, evolved stars with massive progenitors (M >= 3 M_x005F_x005Fsol) at birth time. If more massive than ∼9 M_x005F_x005Fsol, they are destined to undergo a core-collapse supernova. Moderate to rapid rotation, binarity and line-driven mass loss are their three key features. Once hydrogen is depleted in the core of massive stars, they evolve towards the Red Supergiant (RSG) phase on the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale – which is ∼1 000 times shorter than the nuclear timescale. Thus, the chance of finding BSGs inside the Hertzsprung gap is quite slim: Once found, the opportunity ought be seized!

Since BSGs reside in the Galactic disk, high-precision space photometry of BSGs is uniquely possible during K2 campaigns 9 and 11. For field 9, 38 BSGs fall on the silicon. Based on Simbad, they belong to luminosity classes Ia, Ib, II, and III, with spectral types ranging from B0 to B9, and magnitude 8 ≤ V ≤ 12. Pulsation periods in BSGs roughly range from half-a-day to weeks; thus, the long-cadence 3-month K2 photometry is crucial to obtain ∼0.01/d frequency resolution, needed for robust frequency analysis.

For the proposed targets brighter than ∼9th magnitude, we guarantee simultaneous ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with the HERMES (R ∼ 85 000, Mercator Telescope, La Palma, 1.2 m) and HIDES (R ∼ 65 000, OAO, Okayama, 1.9 m) spectrographs. Fainter targets (9 < V ≤ 12) will be also monitored, but with lower cadence during the whole campaign. The spectra will be used for a thorough spectroscopic analysis (extracting detailed abundances, Teff, log g, v sin i, vmacro, Mdot, and v∞), in addition to radial velocity variability (due to binarity), line profile variability (due to pulsations and/or spots), and Hα/Hβ line variability (due to possible episodic mass loss).

The combined spectroscopy and K2 photometry will be used to (a) identify or exclude pulsation variability, (b) draw the observational instability strips, and confront that with our predictions (Moravveji 2016) (c) explore the pulsation excitation mechanism (epsilon- versus κ-mechanism). (d) carry out iterative frequency prewhitening, and search for regularities in frequency and/or periods, (e) characterize possible rotating spots, (f) test the hypothesis that macroturbulence velocity has pulsation origin, (g) trace the surface chemical and rotational velocity evolution, with a possible link to rotational and/or non-rotational mixing processes, and (h) disentangle apparent single stars versus close binaries."
GO9904,9,Gavin,,Ramsay,Armagh Observatory,,,Testing the role of a strong magnetic field in the production of flares from low mass stars,"Flares are seen on a range of stars including our Sun. However, flares from stars with a much lower mass than our Sun are more common. At the start of K2 we initiated a project to observe a range of late type stars to determine how the flare activity depended on mass and hence a better understanding of the underlying physics of flares. Our work will also have implications for determining how flares can effect the habitability of any exoplanets in the stellar system.

Our target for Field 9 is GJ 1224 and is classified in SIMBAD as a known flare star (M4.5V). This together with its brightness (Kepmag=12.0) make it very suitable for short cadence mode data (short duration flares are likely to be missed in long cadence mode). Unlike other flare stars observed with Kepler or K2, there is a body of ground based optical data on this source which suggest it has a low vsini (<3 km/s) (indicating a slow rotation speed or low inclination) but also has evidence for a significant magnetic field (2.7 kG) (Reiners & Basri 2007 ApJ 656 1121). Morin et al (2010 MNRAS 407 2269) obtained spectra which also indicated a significant magnetic field and they inferred a strong dipole field. Our target is also a known X-ray source and has a high LX /Lbol ratio (Delfosse et al 1998 A&A 331 581). Given that none of the M4V stars observed previously using Kepler and K2 have known magnetic fields, GJ 1224 is therefore an excellent target to examine the role that a strong magnetic field has on the rate and energy of stellar flares on low mass stars."
GO9905,9,Csaba,,Kiss,"Konkoly Observatory, MTA CSFK",,,Rotational properties of Quaoar using K2 Campaign 9 data,"(50000) Quaoar is a large object in the classical Kuiper belt, one of the ancient and original populations in the trans-Neptunian region (Brown & Trujillo, 2004, Gladman et al., 2008, Lacerda et al., 2014). Due to its large size (∼1000 km) it is considered to be a very likely dwarf planet. It is a binary object, the orbital period of its moon Weywot is 12.438±0.005 d. Quaoar will be visible during the entire Campaign, at a brightness of V = 18.9 mag.

Here we propose Campaign 9 observations of (50000) Quaoar to obtain a rotational light curve in the optical band. The new K2 light curve will unambiguously determine the rotation period, both clarifying the single-peak period (8.84 or 9.42 h) and reveal whether the observed light curve is single or double peaked, in the latter case with a ∼18 h period. Quaoar has moved ∼15◦ along its orbit since 2003 and the position angle of the spin axis with respect to the line of sight changed accordingly. The comparison of the previous and current light curve amplitudes will constrain the possible spin axis orientations, an important parameter for the thermal emission models. The spin axis orientation is also constrained by the shape observed in the occultation measurements.

We are going to combine the new K2 light curve data with the unpublished Herschel thermal light curve observations and these together will clearly decide whether the light curve is caused by shape or by albedo variegations (see e.g. Lellouch et al., 2010, for a similar study on the dwarf planet Haumea). We will also be able to determine the main thermal characteristics of the surface (and also their rotational phase dependence) more precisely then from light curve average thermal data in Fornasier et al. (2013)."
GO9906,9,Coralie,,Neiner,"LESIA, Paris Observatory, France",,,Understanding classical Be stars thanks to K2’s Field 9,"Classical Be stars are rapidly-rotating pulsating massive stars that host a decretion circumstellar disk. This disk is created from matter ejected by the star through sporadic events. How these ejections occur is not understood yet, but they are most likely related to the very rapid rotation of these stars and to their pulsations. The correlation between pulsations and the ejections of matter was first proposed by Rivinius et al. (2001, A&A 369, 1058) and firmly established by Huat et al. (2009, A&A 506, 95) thanks to CoRoT observations.

K2 Field 9 contains 26 confirmed classical Be stars with 8≤V≤11 that fall on silicon. We request K2 observations of all of them. Pulsations of Be stars are of the order of 1 day, therefore long cadence observations are sufficient for these targets.

Our knowledge of these processes is very limited, and this lack of understanding results in large uncertainties on current stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars. As these models are important cornerstones for several fields of modern astrophysics (e.g., chemical enrichment of galaxies, stellar life cycles and their effects on star and planetary system formation, dynamics of stellar clusters, etc.), these shortcomings need to be resolved.

Asteroseismology is one of the few tools that allow us to study the interiors of stars by the interpretation of their pulsation signal. The last decade brought an immense revolution to the field thanks to the succes of space telescopes such as CoRoT and Kepler, and thanks to vast improvements of asteroseismological techniques. While the nominal Kepler mission already delivered the long-sought-after revolution in stellar physics for solar-like stars and red giants, similar achievements were not possible for massive stars as most of these targets were avoided in the FoV. The scanning nature of the K2 mission provides a few selected fields in or very near the galactic plane that are rich in OB stars, and with this proposal our goal is to exploit the special opportunity given by the position of Field 9 on the Galactic plane to extend K2’s legacy towards the calibration of stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars using hybrid pulsator B dwarves.

We propose the observation of 27 potential hybrid pulsators, which have been selected based on their spectral type and brightness. We propose the relatively brighter stars to avoid serious crowding issues and because for these stars we can conduct simultaneous and follow-up observations with the high-resolution HERMES spectrograph and the 3-channel MAIA CCD camera installed on the 1.2 meter Mercator Telescope on La Palma (operated by the host institute of the PI and the Co-Is, the Institute of Astronomy, KU Leuven)."
GO9908,9,J.J.,,Hermes,University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,,,K2 Observations of 3 Candidate Pulsating WDs in Field 9,"We propose short-cadence observations in Field 9 of the K2 mission of three candidate pulsating white dwarfs, as identified from the VST Photometric Hα Survey of the Southern Galactic Plane and Bulge (VPHAS+)."
GO9909,9,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,,,Recurrent Nova V3890 Sgr,"Recurrent novae (RNe) are ordinary nova systems that have eruptions with a recurrence time scale of faster than a century. They are binary systems where a relatively-normal star orbits close around a white dwarf, spilling matter onto the white dwarf through an accretion disk, where the mass accumulates until a thermonuclear runaway on the surface explodes as the nova event. To get a recurrence time scale shorter than a century, the white dwarf must be near the Chandrasekhar mass, plus the accretion rate must be very high. These exact two conditions, taken simplistically, mean that the white dwarf will soon reach the Chandrasekhar mass and blow up as a Type Ia supernova (SNIa). Indeed, this is the reason why RNe are one of the most popular ideas for the SNIa progenitor.

Only 10 RNe are known in our Milky Way (Schaefer 2010). One of the least known of these is V3890 Sgr. This RN erupted in 1962 and 1990, with an inter-eruption interval of 27.9 years. The eruption light curve peaks at V=8.1, fades by 3.0 mags from peak in 14 days (t3=14 days), displays a plateau, and thus is in class P14 (Schaefer 2010; Strope, Schaefer, & Henden 2010). V3890 Sgr has an M5 red giant companion star. In quiescence, it is at V=15.5, with B-V=0.9, and we discovered the orbital period of 519.7 days from eclipses with a 1.0 mag amplitude (Schaefer 2009). In addition to the orbital modulation, the system shows a low-amplitude 103.8 day red giant oscillation.

We propose V3890 Sgr as a short-cadence target for K2 during Field 9. For 1-minute short-cadence integrations on the V=15.5 star in quiescence, the uncertainty will be ~0.005 mag. The reason for the short-cadence is that V3890 Sgr is known to continually display variations of 0.02 mag on time scales of ten minutes (see Figure 57 of Schaefer 2010), plus fast time resolution is needed to pick up the white dwarf rotation"
GO9910,9,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,,,Kepler's Only Novae in Eruption: V5666 Sgr & V5667 Sgr,"We are proposing to have Kepler look with high cadence at two recent novae in Field 9, with these likely to be the only novae in eruption that Kepler will ever see.

Nova Sgr 2015 No. 1 (V5667 Sgr) was discovered on February 12 of this year, reaching a peak at V=9.0 in late February. We have been following this nova with BVRIJHK measures on 143 nights (see SMARTS website under Walter et al. 2012 and see the figure below). Our light curve shows week-long large-amplitude jitters starting around the time of peak, and hence it is a 'J' class nova (Strope, Schaefer, & Henden 2010). The time to decline by 3.0 magnitudes from peak (t3) is 137 days, pointing to a slow nova. We have also been taking optical spectra, with the nova showing P Cyg lines of Fe II and Hα, with absorption peaking at -100 km/s and extending out to -500 km/s, hence V5667 Sgr is an ordinary slow nova of the FeII spectral class. The J class, long t3, low-excitation iron spectrum, and low expansion velocities are all pointing to a low-mass white dwarf that will have a long and slow decline.

We are proposing to include V5667 Sgr as a target in K2 Field 9. During the time of observation (April to July 2016), we expect the nova to be around V=14.0. (This is based on J class novae with t3~137 days fading from its current V=13.4 at the observed rate of around 0.003 mag/day, as shown in the catalog paper Strope, Schaefer, & Henden 2010.) At this brightness level, a single 1-minute K2 integration will give ~0.003 mag accuracy. V5667 Sgr has a quiescent magnitude of V>21 (as it does not appear on any of the Palomar plates), so during the K2 Field 9 observations, the nova will be >7 mags above quiescent level. That is, K2 will catch this nova while it is still bright in eruption.

Nova Sgr 2014 (V5666 Sgr) was discovered on 15 April 2014, peaking at V=9.8. Our SMARTS BVRIJHK light curve (119 nights over two observing seasons) shows many bright week-long jitters that faded by three magnitudes in 135 days after peak, for a classification of J135 (Strope, Schaefer, & Henden 2010). V5666 Sgr is an Fe II nova, with no high excitation lines, so, along with the 'J' classification, we expect a relatively low-mass white dwarf and a very slow decline. We observe that V5666 Sgr has reently had a V-band decline at 0.005 mag/day and a recent magnitude of V=14.84. With this, the nova will be 16.2 to 16.7 mag. At the middle of this brightness level, a single 1-minute K2 integration will give ~0.010 mag accuracy. V5666 Sgr will be ~6.8 mag below peak and >5 mag above quiescence, so it will be seen by Kepler in eruption.

The Kepler spacecraft has never seen any nova in eruption. After these two recent novae in Field 9, the statistics point to Kepler never having any opportunity to ever see any other nova in eruption. On the basis that V5666 Sgr and V5667 Sgr will be Kepler's only novae in eruption, so we think that these targets are unique and important enough to be accepted as a DDT target. We are proposing for short cadence observations, because novae show several types of variations on time scales much faster than 30 minutes; including white dwarf rotations (like for DQ Her stars), eclipses, the startling flares in the middle of the eruption light curve (as discovered for U Sco), and flickering."
GO9911,9,Andrea,,Kunder,Leibniz Institut für Astrophysik (AIP) Potsdam,,,Precision Pulsation Properties of Bulge RR Lyrae Stars,"We propose to obtain precision pulsation properties of 138 bulge RR Lyrae variables (RRLs), a population of RRLs with the widest metallicity distribution in the Galaxy and a population consisting of double-mode stars with characteristics unlike anywhere else in the Milky Way. From spectroscopically surveying ~1000 bulge RRLs, we have found this population has an abundance distribution spanning three orders of magnitude, suggestive of multiple populations within the bulge RRL, which have also been identified by two RRL sequences in the period-amplitude (Bailey) diagram. Our observations have also indicated that the homogeneous population of double-mode RRLs (RR01 stars) found within 10 deg in the bulge, that was previously explained as stars with a common origin (i.e., remnant from a disrupted dwarf galaxy or stellar cluster), in fact do not have similar dynamics. Therefore their “clumping” in the RR01 period ratio regime needs to be understood in a different, yet unknown manner. With K2, we can undertake a more detailed investigation of the bulge RRLs by obtaining precise periods, amplitudes and magnitudes. These will allow exquisite measurements of the Bailey diagram to trace multiple populations that exist within this old population. The exact RR01 pulsation properties will also open up the possibility to advance the theory of RRL pulsation, as models of RR01 metallicities and masses can be applied and tested on the bulge RR01 stars, a population occupying a unique (more metal-rich) RR01 period ratio regime."
GO9912,9,Ashley,,Pagnotta,American Museum of Natural History,,,Discovering the Orbital Period of the Recurrent Nova V2487 Oph,"We propose V2487 Oph as a short-cadence target for K2 during Field 9. For 1-minute short-cadence integrations on the V=17.5 star in quiescence, the uncertainty will be ~0.02 mag. The reason for the short-cadence is that V2487 Oph is known to continually display variations of >0.1 mag on time scales of ten minutes, and because we expect variations from eclipses or white dwarf spins to be much faster than 30-minutes."
GO9913,9,Bram,,Buysschaert,Paris Observatory,,,K2 Asteroseismology of O-type Stars,"The most massive stars in the Universe have spectral type O and they evolve ultrafast. Their life is not only dominated by their bulk properties such as birth mass and initial metallicity. Rather, various physical processes alter their evolution significantly. This does not only concern their mass loss but also the unknown internal mixing of chemical species by, e.g., convective core overshooting, interior rotation, semi-convection, all of which can be strong effects or rather inhibited by magnetism. Unlike the mass loss, these internal mixing processes are ill constrained from data and imply huge uncertainties on the evolution of O-type stars and by implication on the chemical enrichment of galaxies.

Asteroseismology is so far the only effective way to provide a precise calibration of mixing in the interior of stars. This has not yet been achieved for O stars, because only 14 of them have been monitored with uninterrupted high-precision space photometry, but none for more than a month. In our recent study, Buysschaert et al. (2015, MNRAS, 453, 89) provided a successful proof-of-concept of the method from K2 Campaign 0 data and have shown that future K2 monitoring during at least three months, accompanied by time-resolved highprecision high-resolution spectroscopy opens up the possibility of in-depth O-star seismology. This DDT proposal has the purpose to move from a proof-of-concept from Campaign 0 to an actual application by monitoring the 12 O stars in the field of Campaign 9."
GO9914,9,Bram,,Buysschaert,Paris Observatory,,,K2 Asteroseismology of hot magnetic stars,"About ten percent of all hot stars host a magnetic field at their stellar surface, detectable with current ground-based spectropolarimeters (Wade et al. 2014, IAUS, 302, 265). How these magnetic fields interact with certain layers deep inside the star and how they influence internal physical processes is poorly understood. They can for example alter the efficiency of the internal mixing of chemical species or play a crucial role in the transport of angular momentum. It is therefore assumed that these magnetic fields are important for the stellar structure and evolution of a large number of hot stars.

As it is not possible to look inside a star and study its interior, we resort to asteroseismology to probe the stellar interior by studying their non-radial stellar pulsations. Tremendous progress in asteroseismology has been made over the last decade, since the space-based missions such as the nominal Kepler mission provided a vast amount of data and the asteroseismic techniques improved significantly. However, the number of hot magnetic pulsators studied in detail with high precision space-based photometry is very limited.

With this work, we aim to better understand how the stellar magnetic field influences the non-standard mixing processes governing the interior of hot stars. Through this DDT proposal, we intend to reach this goal by monitoring a significant number of magnetic Ap/Bp stars during Campaign 9 of the K2 mission, pointed towards the Galactic Plane. Moreover, by combining this study with previous K2 monitoring campaigns, we reach a statistically significant number of hot magnetic stars."
GO9915,9,Emese,,Plachy,"Konkoly Observatory, MTA CSFK",,,Classical and Type II Cepheids in the Galactic Bulge,"Cepheid stars are crucial objects for a variety of topics that range from stellar pulsation and the evolution of giant stars to the understanding the structure of the Galaxy and the Universe through the distance measurements they provide. Only a handful of them have been observed by photometric missions so far, but they already revealed new insights. Kepler showed that classical Cepheids may exhibit both period jitter and low­amplitude modulation (Derekas et al. 2012, Kanev et al. 2015). Early data from the K2 mission suggests that cycle­to­cycle variations and/or additional modes are also present in Type II Cepheids (Plachy et al., in prep.). 

Most Cepheids reside within the disk and bulge of the Milky Way, therefore Campaign 9 is the best opportunity the mission can offer for us to observe these stars. The bulge population may provide the bulk of the K2 Cepheid light curves, and can greatly increase the science potential of our regular GO proposals. One proposal, in particular, focuses on the Cepheids in the dwarf galaxy IC1613. With a larger sample size, the planned comparison between the populations of the Milky Way and IC1613 will also be much more robust. "
GO9916,9,Radoslaw,,Smolec,"Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center, Warsaw, Poland",,,RR Lyrae Stars in the Galactic Bulge,"RR Lyr stars populate the bulge in large numbers. The extensive OGLE and ASAS observations were used to select two hundred of the most promising stars, all with interesting or peculiar forms of pulsation. Thus, we have a great opportunity to significantly increase the Kepler+K2 sample of RR Lyr stars with all known forms of pulsation, also with members of classes that were never or scarcely observed from space. The 3-month K2 light curves will be extended by and will benefit from the synergy with the OGLE and ASAS projects, which provide several-year long multicolor photometry. This will allow the characterization of the long-term behavior of these stars, to put the three month long K2 observations into context. Conversely, the K2 observations provide high-precision snapshots, which complement the ground-based surveys. A simple procedure for computing [Fe/H] values has also been established for the Kp band (Nemec et al. 2013). K2 observations of the bulge targets will strongly increase the scientific outcome of our Guest Observer RR Lyr proposals. These observations allow us to study phenomena that have never been studied from space before. "

GO9918,9,Venu,,Kalari,Armagh Observatory,,,Wind clumping in O stars,"We plan long cadence monitoring of 20 O stars in K2 falling on silicon in K2 campaign field 9. These are O stars located in the W33, and M8 regions, whose spectral types have been classified previously. They span a range from O3–O9 spectral types, and include both dwarf and giant stars. The extinction and distance to these stars means that they fall within the K2 saturation limit of KP>11mag, and therefore do not require additional pixels and larger apertures to observe.

We aim to combine the K2 frequency spectra of the 20 O stars, with high-resolution contemporaneous spectra taken using guaranteed time at the SALT telescope. This will ensure precise spectral classification, measurement of wind terminal velocity, clumping and mass loss rates for the O stars (Bouret et al. 2015). Using the frequency spectra, the data can be used to probe their interior structures (Aerts & Rogers 2015) and understand the clumping mechanisms and test whether a subsurface convective zone really causes clumping and hotspots in O stars."

We have recently discovered for the first time a large number of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way bulge, which are prime candidates for being the oldest known objects in the Universe (Howes et al., 2015, Nature, 527, 484).

These observations are key to understanding the evolution of the RCB stars because their masses cannot be accurately estimated by other means. Only one RCB star, V1157 Sgr, has been observed during the Field 1-8 campaigns. It is being observed now in Campaign 7 so no data are yet available. Field 9 contains eight additional RCB stars. The ∼75 days of near continuous, high-precision observations will provide an opportunity to use Kepler to observe the brightness variations of RCB stars. These observations will be at least two orders of magnitude more precise than the existing ground-based photometry, typically with a cadence of once per night and uncertainties & 0.01 mag. These observations will provide the first detailed look at the pulsation mechanisms and modes in a sample of RCB stars. It is also likely that one or more of the stars will form dust during the campaign which would be of great interest because a correlation between pulsation phase and the timing of dust formation has been found in several RCB stars (Crause et al. 2007, MNRAS, 375, 301)."
GO9921,9,Ann Marie,,Cody,NASA Ames,,,K2 Campaign 9: Monitoring Massive Young Stars in the Lagoon Nebula,"The mechanisms of variability in young stars are intimately tied to their structure and environment. Decades of photometric monitoring have shown that T Tauri stars are highly variable, and that this variability is connected with starspot modulation, circumstellar extinction, and unsteady accretion. Yet only recently have space telescopes provided the high cadence, high precision, long baseline photometric monitoring necessary for discerning and categorizing light curve patterns. This exquisite data has come largely from two projects: the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of NGC 2264 using the CoRoT telescope (CSI 2264; Cody et al. 2014), and K2’s Campaign 2 observations of the Upper Scorpius and ρ Ophiuchus regions. These efforts have shown that young, low-mass stars display at least eight different types of light curve morphologies.

A key question that has emerged is how the observed light curve fluctuations are tied to physical mechanisms and circumstellar dust properties, as a function of stellar mass and age. The CSI 2264 and K2 C2 efforts that we are involved in focus mainly on 3-10 Myr old stars of K/M spectral types. Yet sparse ground-based monitoring of the higher mass Herbig stars (e.g., Herbst & Shevchenko 1999) has shown that nearly all earlier type accreting stars are variable as well. K2 has the chance to provide optical monitoring data on the relatively unexplored area of high mass star variability during its Campaign 9, which will include the ~1 Myr old high-mass star cluster NGC 6530 (i.e., Lagoon Nebula and its ~60 B stars)."

Recent observations evidently suggest that WR stars are probable progenitors of stripped envelope supernovae (Type Ib/c and IIb). However, the fundamental parameters of WR stars, such as masses and radii, are extremely hard to determine through traditional photometric and spectroscopic methods, because of their high level of activity in terms of strong stellar winds and due to the complex surface phenomena. The fast temporal sampling and unprecedented photometric precision of K2 provide a unique opportunity for asteroseismology of WR stars, which opens a new window to their fundamental parameters. Here we propose to obtain K2 light curves of 17 WR stars in its Campaign 9. In order to maximize the scientific gain of this program, we will arrange photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations on the ground for WR stars with pulsations detected by K2."

As our knowledge of stellar physics progresses, models must be anchored to empirically determined measurements to reliably predict properties of stars for which direct observations are difficult to obtain.

The most powerful tests of stellar models come from the brightest stars, for which complementary observational techniques such as astrometry, asteroseismology, and interferometry can be combined. We propose long-cadence observations of the brightest K2 stars in Campaign 9.

This is in great part due to the exquisite data that have been made available by NASAs Kepler space telescope, with detections of solar-like oscillations made in several hundred field stars, including a statistical sample of exoplanet hosts. Extension of Keplers capabilities to the ecliptic through the repurposed K2 mission thus offers a unique opportunity to continue asteroseismic studies of solar-type stars.

The aim of the present proposal is to perform an asteroseismic study of bright solar-type stars that reside in the solar neighborhood, making use of short-cadence (SC) data collected by K2 during Campaigns 8 (C8) and 10 (C10). The information contained in solar-like oscillations allows the internal stellar structure to be constrained to unprecedented levels, while also allowing fundamental stellar properties (e.g., mass, radius, and age) to be precisely determined. These results will be used in a variety of ongoing investigations that are relevant to this solicitation:
""	We seek to take advantage of the opportunity to observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed during the nominal mission, thus benefiting from better independent constraints (e.g., from parallaxes, spectroscopy, interferometry etc.). This will make it possible to apply the full potential of asteroseismology to tests of stellar interiors physics (e.g., placing constraints on convective overshooting).
""	By combining the targets observed during C8 and C10 with targets from previous K2 campaigns as well as from the nominal mission, we may study the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood and place constraints on the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars.
""	These targets will further expand the sample of benchmark stars having precise fundamental properties from asteroseismology to different fields in the Galaxy, which will be crucial to calibrate upcoming large surveys such as Gaia and GALAH.
""	The availability of precise asteroseismic ages of stars with detectable surface rotation periods will provide additional calibrators for gyrochronology.
""	Asteroseismology will allow us to better characterize targets with detected exoplanets, including any new detections made by K2 as well as known exoplanet-host stars. Bright solar-type hosts, for which asteroseismology and radial-velocity follow-up are available, provide the possibility to fill up the planet mass-radius diagram.
""	The possibility of detecting solar-like oscillations in members of stellar binaries provides an independent test to the accuracy of asteroseismic estimates of fundamental stellar properties.

Based on previous proposals, we estimate requesting for 30 to 40 targets per campaign. These targets should show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes, meaning that SC data are a pre-requisite for detecting the oscillations. We will be preparing analysis-ready light curves from the target pixel data using in-house software. Next, we shall apply well-tested analysis procedures to the frequency-power spectra of the light curves. These procedures will be used to estimate both the global seismic parameters and the parameters describing individual modes of oscillation (in particular their frequencies). Finally, detailed frequency modeling using state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes will provide the properties of the stars. An important aspect will be to understand the systematics on the derived properties that arise from changes in the input physics and the effects introduced by different evolutionary codes. The methodology delineated above has already been successfully applied to the analysis of K2 Campaign 1 data, for which we reached a very good understanding of the asteroseismic detection yield."
GO10003,10,Barry,,Smalley,Keele University,b.smalley@keele.ac.uk,"Holdsworth, Daniel L; Murphy, Simon James; Ripepi, Vincenzo; Catanzaro, Gianni","The Am stars: peculiarities, pulsations and planets","The metallic-line (Am) stars are a sub-class of A-type stars which exhibit strong lines of transition elements and weakening of Ca and Sc lines compared to the strength of the Balmer lines. The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars needs to be rotating more slowly than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 2 and 10 days. 

The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. Many, but not all, Am stars therefore do pulsate, generally with lower amplitude than normal abundance delta Scuti stars. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars. 

Currently there are only two A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33 and Kepler-13A). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars. 

Using Kepler and K2, we have a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to: 
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binary within the Am stars, 
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars. 

Only 15 Am stars were observed during the original Kepler mission. So far with K2 a further 61 stars have been observed during K2 Campaigns 0 to 5. For this proposal we have 2 targets for Campaign 8 and 14 targets for Campaign 10 to be observed in Long Cadence mode. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to around 100.

The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."

Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars. Many happen to pulsate, and many of these are also in short-period binaries, and that provides us with sensitive probes of their structure. In C8, there is a known p-mode sdB star in a long-period binary with an FV star. This provides only the second rich p-mode example using Kepler, with binarity as a bonus! 
     From Kepler's main mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes, determine rotation periods, detect Doppler boosting, and to constrain structure models from period spacings, frequency multiplets, and subsynchrous rotators via binarity. From K2 (F0 and F1), we have found the longest-period sdB+M binary and the first subsynchronously rotating ellipsoidal variable; both with pulsating sdB stars!
     Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age since some stars show substantial mode trapping while in others it appears to be absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of different evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models and see how HB cores evolve.
     Frequency multiplets also tell us the rotation period and orientation of the pulsation axis. From this information we have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary period down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components; allowing us to explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection.
     We have made significant progress and amazing discoveries from the original Kepler mission and our first K2 targets. However, to fully exploit those advances, we need to complete the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). And C8 includes a known p-mode pulsator, which would be only the second one observed by Kepler, providing extremely valuable information.
     To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of two pulsating sdB stars in C8 and C10, with PG 0048 in C8 an already established pulsator.
     Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.
     We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include graduate and undergraduate students as significant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training."

and of 65 bright quasars drawn from other surveys in Fields 8 and 10. The first goal is to characterize the variability of 3C 273 on timescales from minutes to months using continuous observations for 75 days, which has never been done before. Our  second goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in the quasars at the time of K2 observations. The three candidate origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk (AD) with one or more thermal emitting regions. Our third  goal is to see how the optical variability amplitude and power spectral densities (PSDs) of the three main classes of quasars --blazars, radio-loud quasars, and radio-quiet quasars --differ on minute-to-months timescales. The candidate origins for optical emission from radio-loud quasars are the same as those for blazars, but without enhanced relativistic beaming in the jet. Optical variations in radio-quiet quasars may originate in an AD with multiple thermal emission regions. We will measure the PSDs of the light curves and determine the PSD slopes which are related to the underlying variability processes, such as turbulence in the relativistic jets or stochastic fluctuations in thermal emission from segments of the AD."
GO10006,10,Mukremin,,Kilic,University of Oklahoma,kilic@ou.edu,"Mullally, Fergal; Loeb, Abraham; Debes, John Henry; Agol, Eric",Habitable Planets Around White Dwarfs in Fields 8 and 10,"The search for planets in the habitable zone has so far focused on solar-type stars and M dwarfs. However, transiting planets in the habitable zone around white dwarfs (WDs) may be common  and they provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on an exoplanet. The habitable zone around WDs extends from 0.005 AU to 0.02 AU (P = 4-30 h, Agol 2011) for WDs older than about 1 Gyr. Since WDs are slightly larger than Earth, Earth-size and even smaller planets can easily be detected. We expect the planets within 1 AU of solar type stars to be destroyed in the giant phase. Hence, planets in the habitable zone around WDs must arrive there after this phase. There are several ways to form such planets near the WD or bring them closer (see the Kepler white paper by our team). Planets have been detected around evolved, post-main-sequence stars. In addition, tidally disrupted asteroids and dwarf planets have been detected around 4.3% of WDs in the form of debris disks. If the history of exoplanet science has taught us anything, it is that planets are ubiquitous and they exist in the most unusual places, including very close to their host stars and even around pulsars. 

Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability of the Kepler 2 mission to perform a transit survey of the WDs in Fields 8 and 10. Using spectroscopy, photometry, and astrometry data from the McCook & Sion White Dwarf catalog, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the SuperCosmos Sky Survey, we identify 273 WDs on active silicon in Fields 8 and 10. We propose LC observations of all WD targets. 

SC observations would have the best constraints on transiting planets around WDs. However, given the small number of SC slots available, LC mode data will still enable us to achieve our science goals. Planets in the habitable zone would eclipse their stars for about 2 min. Hence, the LC mode data will dilute the transit signal by a factor of 15. However, since the transit depth is >50% for an Earth-size or bigger planet around an average size WD, these transits will have >3% depth in the LC data, and they will still be visible. Even with the decreased sensitivity of the 2wheel mode, Kepler can still detect transits of Earth-size or bigger planets around WDs. 

The probability for a transit by an Earth-size planet at 0.01 AU is 1%. Hence, the discovery of habitable planets around WDs requires a survey of at least 100 targets, if all of them have such planets. Previously, we proposed for K2 observations of about 500 target WDs in Fields 0-7. The addition of the 273 WDs from Fields 8 and 10 will bring the total number of WDs surveyed by the K2 mission to about 770. This survey will provide the first constraints on the frequency of habitable planets around WDs. Our proposed survey is relatively cheap due to the relatively small number of WD targets in Fields 8 and 10 . On the other hand, this survey is capable of finding the first planets in the WD habitable zone, and the James Webb Space Telescope is capable of obtaining the first spectroscopic measurements of such planets. 

In addition to the transit search, the 30-min cadence of the LC data is well suited for measuring the rotation periods for a large number of WDs for the first time. WDs have typical rotation periods of a few hours to a few days, though there are only a handful of measurements available. Kepler's precision provides an excellent opportunity to measure the rotation periods for our targets, including the ones with relatively weak magnetic fields. We have already analyzed the K2 data from Fields 0 and 1, and identified a 2.4h period eclipsing double WD system (paper in prep) and detected variability in about a dozen WDs. The former system displays 70s long eclipses (as confirmed from the ground), and demonstrates our team's ability in making excellent use of the K2 data."
GO10007,10,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transits,"To date almost nothing is known about the final (WD) configuration of ~97% of planetary systems! While not a single bona-fide planet has been identified orbiting an isolated WD (Faedi+2011,MNRAS 410, 899), it is now widely accepted that the dusty and/or gaseous disks that we see within one solar radius around many WDs are produced by the tidal disruption of asteroids (Farihi+2010, MNRAS 404, 2123). An increasing fraction of WDs (>=27%) show a metal enrichment due to the fall into the WD atmosphere of ancient planetary material (Koester+2014, A&A 566, 34), whose chemical composition is similar to that seen in different Solar-system meteorites (Gansicke+2012, MNRAS 424, 333).
Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and the AGB phases (Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). While Gaia will discover WD planets at several AUs from their host stars, those external to the period gap (Silvotti+2014, arXiv1412.3307), this proposal aims to study the inner boundary of the period gap. Substellar companions to sdB stars offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion, thermal pulses and PN ejection, Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ 761, 121), and they represent the natural 1st step to study the post-RGB evolution of planetary systems and their final architecture. Star/planet interactions during the RGB may be responsible for the stellar envelope ejection leading to the formation of a single sdB star (Soker 1998, AJ 116, 1308; Han+2012, PASP Conf.Ser. 452, 3).
Among 18 planet/BD candidates around sdB stars (Silvotti+2014, ASP Conf.Ser. 481, 13), 2 planetary systems were detected by Kepler measuring the photometric modulation due to reflection/re-emission of the star light (Charpinet+2011, Nature 480, 496; Silvotti+2014, A&A 570, 130). Given that only 7 single sdBs were observed by Kepler for enough time to detect tiny photometric variations of 20-50 ppm, we can assume that 2/7 of sdBs have Earth-size bodies in tight orbits at ~0.005 AU from the star. With a geometric transit probability of 0.2 (Rp<<RsdB, RsdB=0.001 AU), the prob. to see a transit is about 0.057, i.e., in average, we need to observe ~18 sdB stars to see one transit. 
Similar numbers are obtained for the more massive companions detected through RVs: Geier et al. 2012 (ASP Conf. Ser. 452, 153) found that 16% of their sample of 27 single-lined sdBs do show small RV variations compatible with massive substellar companions. Here the geom. transit probability at 0.005 AU is ~0.28 (Rp=0.9 Rjup) so that, in average, 1 sdB out of ~22 should show transits and secondary eclipses.
The main goal of this proposal is to detect sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targetting in SC ~40 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. SC is required as the typical transit duration for a close planet with 6h<Porb<24h is 15 to 40 min.
The transit depth may vary between 25% (Jovian radius) down to 0.2% (Earth radius). Given the high number of transits in a ~90 days observation, K2 should be able to measure objects with a radius smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, PEPSI@LBT (presently in commissioning) and EXPRESSO@VLT (first light in 2016) will be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.
The secondary goal of this proposal is to detect photometric variations due to reflection effects by a faint stellar companion, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting. Kepler has already given an important contribution to this field. K2 can increase by a factor 5 to 10 the statistics of well studied sdB+WD and sdB+M-dwarf systems. We point out that the secondary goal is compatible with LC data."
GO10008,10,Aleks,,Scholz,University of St Andrews,as110@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Matt, Sean P; Stelzer, Beate; Peterson, Dawn E","Rotation of M dwarfs: spindown, activity, and gyrochronology","Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter for the evolution of stars and planets. Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy. 

Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012). For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission. 

The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars. 

Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem. 

Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013). 

Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. Several hundred of them (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields from 2014 to 2016. For fields 8-10, observed in 2016, we propose to include ~100 targets in the K2 fields for these campaigns for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them will fall onto the Kepler chips. For the subsequent fields we will submit similarly sized numbers of objects. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner in the context of a PhD project supervised by all three co-investigators."

Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system [1-5], colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk [6-7], and studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength which may limit models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration of planetesimals. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies.

Light curves of Hilda asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. This population is in the stable 3:2 resonance with Jupiter at 4 AU and collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations [8-9]. Results from the WISE survey suggest that  ~40% of Hilda asteroids are either extremely elongated objects, or are binaries[10]. Kepler optical light curves are required to confirm these controversial findings. Ground based optical surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability survey. Large amounts of observing time are required, and analysis of lightcurves obtained over a few nights is hampered by aliasing induced by limited photometric sampling over regularly spaced nightly intervals. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform.

We have identified ~12 objects for study in the Hilda asteroid populations to be studied with Kepler in Campaigns 8 & 10 with magnitudes of m_V < 20. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 40 days for our targets. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity to test the results reported by the WISE survey.

On the expected white dwarf rotation periods (about 1 day, generalizing from nonradially pulsating white dwarfs), the low amplitude of the expected variations renders them extremely difficult to detect using ground-based photometry. K2 will be able to observe many well-studied field (and cluster) white dwarfs. Measurement of rotation modulation (or even upper limits to photometric amplitude variations) will further exploit those data to teach us about magnetic fields in these stars that are otherwise inaccessible observationally. In the nonradially pulsating white dwarfs, we can independently measure the rotation rate, providing a test of asteroseismic rotation periods."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is know about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. However, our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed in campaigns 8 and 10 of the Kepler K2 mission identifies 2,926 high-velocity subdwarfs that are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, to identify and characterize the first generation of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will be complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."
GO10013,10,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,Rotation rates for stars in wide binary systems and a search for hierarchical triples,"Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and chemical composition. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated (which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are). Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 8 and 10, we have identified a total of 219 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 60. Our statistical analysis indicates that at least 80% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignment of unrelated stars). Half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. Most secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, most pairs can also be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target. One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, and thus a significant fraction of wide binaries are actually hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or event contact) binary star; we can test this prediction in our sample by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries."

GO10015,10,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Xue, Zhichao; Landolt, Arlo U; Clem, James L",How Constant are Standard Stars?,"How constant are standard stars?  Of the original 104 standard stars for Johnson's UBV system, 80% are known or suspected variables (Landolt 2013).  The Landolt standards have typical single-measurement errors of 1.4% in the V, and with averages of 15 individual observations on 8 nights (Landolt 1992), so many types of variability will be missed.  Similarly, the Sloan u'g'r'i'z' standard stars have accurately-measured average-magnitudes, but the variability for individual stars could be as large as 1%-3%.  According to R. Bohlin, the three primary standard stars for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) could easily be variable at the 1% level.

If the variability of standard stars is at the 1%-3% level, it would become critical for several large-scale enterprises in astrophysics.  For example, the massive efforts to use supernovae for cosmology now have the calibration error for the standard stars as the largest uncertainty in the error budget (e.g., Amanullah et al. 2010), so the only way to advance in our knowledge of Dark Energy is to get better standard stars.  The supernova community has set the ambitious goal of calibration to the 1% level, so standards are needed to much better than the 1% level.  All these efforts and goals are denied if the standard stars themselves vary at the 1% level, or if even some substantial fraction vary at the 0.5% or 0.3% level.

Ground-based and HST space-based observations have proven ineffective at testing standard stars for variability at smaller than the 1%-3% level.  But Kepler is perfect for testing standard stars for variability down to the millimag level over a very wide range of timescales.  But to make any such test, the standards must be in the Kepler field of view.  Most standards are either along the equator or far from the ecliptic.  For all of the K2 fields 0-13, it turns out that standard stars are only visible in K2 Fields 8 and 10.  So K2 Cycle 3 is the only opportunity to measure the real variability of standard stars.

We have identified 25 Landolt standards in Field 8, 11 Landolt standards in Field 10, and 7 Sloan standards in Field 10.  These standards are from 11th to 16th mag, right in Kepler's sweet-spot, so we will get better than millimag accuracy for all our targets.  We propose to use K2 to get long-cadence light curves to test all 41 stars for their levels of variability.  Our analysis will consist of performing Fourier transforms seeking periodic variations, the calculation of the RMS variability on long and short timescales (with correction for Poisson noise), a flare search, and the peak-to-peak variations on timescales long enough so that Poisson noise does not dominate.  Our product will be the full characterization of the variability of all 70 standard stars, resulting in fractions of stars of various types that are variable at greater than several levels.

The results of our K2 Cycle 3 program will have far reaching effects.  If we find that some substantial fraction of standards have variability at the 0.5% level or more, then the many communities will have to work hard to solve the problem.  Our results might point to some type of standards as having the lowest variability.  Our results can quantify how many standard star observations are needed to beat down the variability each night.  Or if we find variability to be common and large enough, then this would point to a path involving NIST-calibrated light sources flown in the upper atmosphere.

RELEVANCE:  NASA-funded experiments need calibration to the 1% level, so standard stars need be constant to much better than 1%, yet current measures of standards have not gotten tests below the 1%-3% level.  Only the K2 mission can measure the real low-amplitude variability of standard stars, and these are only visible during Cycle 3 (i.e., Fields 8 and 10).

GO10016,10,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,"Hudson, Hugh S",Superflares on RS CVn and BY Dra Stars,"It came as a startling surprise when otherwise-ordinary G-type main sequence stars (including some of the closest known solar twins) were discovered to have flares with energies 10^34 to 10^39 ergs (Schaefer et al. 2000).  These 'superflares' have durations from minutes to days, amplitudes up to 3 mags, and emission from X-ray to radio.  Kepler has made for a revolution in superflares by providing large event numbers on many Sun-like stars (Maehara et al. 2012; Schaefer 2012).  The most popular current model has reconnection of the magnetic fields stretching between the Sun-like star and a nearby planet (Rubenstein & Schaefer 2000; Lanza 2008).  This scenario was explicitly stealing the model for RS CVn superflares.

RS CVn stars are G-type main sequence stars in close orbit (1-14 day orbital periods) around cooler stars, with synchronization speeding up the stellar rotations and hence increasing greatly the magnetic activity of the stars.  BY Dra stars are similar to RS CVns, with a somewhat cooler surface and sometimes apparently single.  RS CVn and BY Dra stars have occasional superflares, with energies up to 10^38 erg, durations from hours to a day, amplitudes up to 1.6 mag, and emission from X-ray to radio.  Models for RS CVn superflares all involve magnetic reconnection with loops stretching between the G-star and the cool star (Simon et al. 1980; Ferreira 1998).  The difference in energy between solar flares and RS CVn superflares is that the loop length could be much longer and the surface field much stronger.  The field configuration, trigger, and detailed microphysics of RS CVn superflares are poorly known (Ferreira 1998).

A small number of RS CVn superflares have been reasonably observed from X-ray to optical to radio.  Nevertheless, there are two glaring problems in the RS CVn data:  First, the coverage has been much too haphazard and gap-filled, so demographic properties are badly known.  Second, only the largest RS CVn superflares have been detected and reported, leaving it completely unknown as to the existence, frequency, and properties of any low-amplitude events.

We propose to use the K2 mission to monitor RS CVn and BY Dra stars for superflares.  K2 can uniquely solve the two big problems because the relentless gapless coverage for ~80 days will provide uniform and biasfree flare searches, and because the millimag accuracy allows for the confident detection of superflares with amplitudes over two orders-of-magnitude smaller.  No RS CVn star was targeted in the original Kepler  field or in any K2 field, other than the 25 RS CVns and 2 BY Dra stars that we proposed for Fields 4-7.

We have identified 8 RS CVn stars and 2 BY Dra stars (in Fields 8 and 10) brighter than 16th mag that K2fov gives as being on-chip.  For flares found, amplitudes, durations, orbital phases, energy estimates, and light curves would be published, along with demographic results like size-frequency distributions.  The great statistics from K2 will be able to perform tests like measuring the orbital phase dependence of flare frequency so as to distinguish between the magnetic loop and the magnetospheric tail reconnection models.

RELEVANCE:  RS CVn and BY Dra superflares fit into a larger picture of superflares on Sun-like stars, with these other superflares having similar observational properties.  A goal of this K2 proposal is to test how similar are the types of superflares, with this having good relevance for NASA's goal of understanding the biggest solar flares.  Only the K2 mission has the gapless long-term coverage with millimag accuracy as required to spot large and small superflares.

E.",K2 Observations of Variable White Dwarfs in Fields 8 and 10,"We propose observations of variable white dwarfs in Fields 8 & 10 of the K2 mission. We propose short-cadence observations of known and high-probability pulsating white dwarfs within the empirical DAV instability strip. We additionally propose observations of known magnetic and convective-atmosphere white dwarfs to constrain magnetic activity in these stars.

As they cool, white dwarf stars with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres pulsate as DAVs (a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) when they reach the appropriate effective temperature to foster a hydrogen partial-ionization zone, which efficiently drives global oscillations. This range of temperatures empirically spans roughly 12,600-11,100 K for typical-mass (0.6 Msun), log g = 8.0 white dwarfs (Gianninas et al. 2011, ApJ, 743, 138). Pulsating white dwarfs provide an important glimpse into the interior of the future of the vast majority (> 97%) of all stars in our Galaxy, including our Sun, allowing us to probe the masses and compositions of their electron-degenerate cores, as well as of their non-degenerate envelopes; to determine their internal rotation profiles; and to detect weak magnetic fields (see reviews by Winget & Kepler 2008 (ARA&A, 46, 157) and Fontaine & Brassard 2008 (PASP, 120, 1043).

Since the DAV instability strip is defined by temperature, color selection is an excellent predictor of variability. Our team discovered all DAVs in the original Kepler mission, which has led to exquisite insight into white dwarf interiors. We have applied the same photometric selection methods to K2 Fields 8 & 10 using the SDSS, and have identified 15 excellent candidate white dwarfs on silicon in each field with colors consistent with the empirical DAV instability strip. Additionally, there are five previously known, confirmed pulsating white dwarfs in Field 8 (SDSS J0052-0051, GD 842, SDSS J1112+0009, WD J0050-0023, WD J0111+0018) and three in Field 10 (PG 1159-035, WD J1200-0251, and WD J1244-0221). Notably, PG1159-035 (V=15.0 mag) was the subject of one of the first Whole Earth Telescope runs -- a coordinated global multi-site campaign in 1989 March (Winget et al. 1991, ApJ, 378, 326) -- and is one of the best-studied and richest pulsating white dwarfs known.

Every new pulsating white dwarf we can observe with Kepler adds value, since it brings us that much closer to statistically significant studies of white dwarfs with ensemble asteroseismology (e.g. Chaplin et al. 2011, Science, 332, 213). With typical pulsations ranging from 100-1400 s, we require short-cadence observations of these white dwarfs. Minute-cadence K2 observations have the added benefit of catching transits/eclipses of the white dwarf, revealing any unresolved double-degenerate binaries or even planetary companions.

Additionally, we propose observations of multiple convective and/or possibly magnetic white dwarfs in Fields 8 and 10 to carry out the first in-depth study into the magnetic activity of the endpoints of stellar evolution. These long-baseline photometric observations will test white dwarf variability on a large scale and in a completely new regime."

The small size of a white dwarf (WD) star (approx. 1 Earth radii) implies that any sub-stellar or gas giant companion at suitable orbital inclination will completely eclipse it, while terrestrial bodies smaller than the Moon, including asteroids, will still produce transits that are detectable in high signal/noise light-curves.

Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approx. 25% at circa 1Gyr, Zuckerman et al.2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.

The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically signicant (500 to 1000) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a signicant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).

A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al.(2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al.(2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD?

This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery. 

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm (5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 169 and 108 WDs (campaigns 8 and 10 respectively), that have been spectroscopically identified or are deemed to have a 90% or greater probability of being a WD (Fusillo et al. 2015), and which are brighter than Kepler Magnitude 19.5 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues."
GO10020,10,Bradley,E.,Schaefer,Louisiana State University,schaefer@lsu.edu,,Short-Duration Flares on Mira Stars in Fields 8 & 10,"Mira stars are slowly pulsating red giant stars with periods of order a year, so it came as a startling surprise when they were discovered to have short-duration flares (Schaefer 1991).  These flares were observed with amplitudes 0.4 to 1.4 mag and durations from 3 minutes to 3 hours, and were visible in both the optical and the radio.  Mira flares have been confirmed by Maffei & Tosti (1995), de Laverny et al. (1998), and Stencel et al. (2003), with flare durations lasting up to 6 days.  However, studies by Mais et al. (2004), Wozniak et al. (2004), and Lebzelter (2011) have failed to find any flares on various samples of red giants.  It is currently unclear what subset of Mira stars and what phases show flares, no detailed models have been made, and we have little knowledge of flare demographics.  Models of Mira flares (e.g., Struck et al. 2002) point to magnetic reconnection involving planets orbiting the Mira star.
	
The original Kepler mission did look at 317 M giant stars, but this includes only two classic Mira stars (Banyai et al. 2013).  They do not report any flares, but they only report on Fourier transforms for periods longer than a day, so this study was not sensitive to Mira flares.  Nevertheless, this study provides a proof that Kepler can follow Mira stars with 30-minute time resolution and ~0.1 millimag accuracy.  I have already made successful K2 proposals for 3+32+3+2+2+47 Miras in Fields 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  I have already fully analyzed data for five Miras (for a total of 0.84 Mira-years) and have found no flares down to 0.7 millimag amplitude.  With Mira flares being rare, perhaps once in several years when averaged over all Miras, an accumulation of many years of exposure is required to get significant demographics for flares.  For K2 Fields 8 & 10, I have selected 1 and 3 targets, all confirmed Mira variables that are always brighter than V=16.  
	
I propose to have Kepler monitor 4 Mira stars during the K2 mission for Fields 8 & 10, with the 30-minute cadence, with the goal to be to discover flares from a few minutes to days in duration.  The analysis is to run the light curve through a flare finder as used for Gamma-Ray Burst triggering, because this is an identical task of searching for flares of unknown time, size, and shape on a roughly-sinusoidal varying background, with a 5.5 sigma threshold accounting for the many time intervals over the many stars.  This statistical limit will be applicable to fast flares, with our experience showing that the real limit is imposed by 'faint' cosmic rays that cannot be recognized by changed PSFs.  For flares found, amplitudes, durations, phases, energy estimates, and light curves would be published, along with demographic results like size-frequency distributions.
	
RELEVANCE.    Ground-based light curves are notoriously difficult to find small rare flares, while the Kepler satellite solves this due to having sub-millimag accuracy and a relentless light curve without gaps for many months.  So Kepler is unique at being able to address the many big unknowns regarding Mira flares.  My small K2 program will increase the number of Mira stars monitored by Kepler from 2 (for the original Kepler field) to 95 (with Fields 0-10), and so will make such a big advance that it has the potential for solving many of the questions.  K2 will provide the first accurate and full-coverage light curve for the startling flares on Mira stars, and will give detailed demographic properties, like flare frequency/size/duration as a function of Mira type, period, and phase.

stars. Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with
the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations,
multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have
accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate
parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR

stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to

metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation
rates.  The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the

The goal is to record via the LC mode the long term photometric variability in each of these systems. Long term variability in several CV system types is known to be due to precession -- tidal torques by the secondary star on the disk around the primary star. For the first time ever, Kepler found in previous campaigns a long term variability in Algol systems, with WX Dra from Kepler Quarters 2-4, 6-8, 10-12, and 14-16 being the poster system. This long term variability has never been observed and confirmed from the ground, necessitating the need for the K2 campaigns. In this work, we hypothesize the source to this long term variability in Algol systems as a precession. Through modeling of the CV and Algol light curves, we aim to determine the type of precession in the Algol systems (i.e., whether prograde or retrograde) and to identify the source to the modulated light (e.g., from a precession of a bright/hot spot hitting a disk around the primary in the Algol, from a precession of a bright/hot spot hitting the primary's photosphere, from a precession of the disk, etc. and not due to star spots or exoplanets). As CVs and Algols share the same dynamics of the mass transfer process in close binary systems and the largest difference between CVs and Algols is the orbital period (or, similarly, the separation distance), this K2 study naturally fits into the long term goals of further establishing the connections between these two types of close binary systems and the evolutions of these star systems. In addition to the K2 observations, we will also observe some of these K2 target candidates (and other like systems) from the ground to establish a photometric modulation baseline. To complete these tasks, we have put together a team of experts in CVs and Algols and we include two students."

So far, stars brighter than Kp < 6 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 long-cadence observations of the brightest (Kp < 6.3 mag) K2 stars in campaign 8 & 10 using a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels. Asteroseismic studies of these targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants and insights into poorly understood internal processes of intermediate-mass stars such as convective core overshooting.

We selected 18 targets including A stars and red giants with Kp < 6.3 mag from the Hipparcos catalog. We will use small (~20x20 pixel) circular apertures around the saturated core for each target, and perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method has been demonstrated to successfully recover pulsations of saturated giant stars observed in K2 Campaign 1. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Our proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics, a key science goal of the K2 mission. Our project furthermore supports galactic astrophysics, another key science area identified in the NRA, through the calibration of scaling relations for galactic archeology studies. A better understanding of stellar models through the study of bright stars is relevant for science goals pursued by both present and future NASA missions such as the characterization of exoplanets (TESS, JWST) as well as stellar populations and galaxy formation/evolution (HST, JWST)."
GO10027,10,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,"Sharma, Sanjib; Stello, Dennis",Identifying K Giants of the Remote Halo with K2 in C8 and C10,"Goals

The goal of this proposal is to identify a significant new sample of red giants in the halo of the Galaxy at large distances, 50 to 100 kpc and beyond. These are the best tracers of the remote halo, for at their high luminosities they remain visible to 100 kpc, and their presence in populations of all metallicities and ages ensures an unbiased sample of the stellar population.

The primary difficulty in their identification is distinguishing them from foreground dwarfs, which form the overwhelming majority of stars at these magnitudes and colors. Roughly 300 giants at distances > 50 kpc spread over the sky have now been identified from SDSS SEGUE spectra, but with a bias towards low metallicities and hotter giants, introduced by the selection criteria for targeting stars for SEGUE spectral observations to increase the giant yield.

Methods

Here we propose to identify the redder, cooler, more luminous giants, where the u-g vs. g-r diagram provides some giant-dwarf discrimination. We propose K2 long-cadence light curves for six hundred potential luminous red giants with 0.9 <= (g-r)o <= 1.3, to identify such giants by detecting and measuring nu_max, the peak in the power spectrum due to solar-like (p-mode) oscillations. In these cool, luminous stars such peaks are detectable even at faint magnitudes using long-cadence data. In contrast, the power-spectrum peaks of the intervening dwarfs will not be detected at all, due to their higher frequencies and lower amplitudes. As standards we add sixty stars with 0.7 <= (g-r)o <= 1.2 already identified as giants.

In addition to the (g-r)o limits, which restrict their temperatures to cooler than 4600K, our six hundred potential red giants on-silicon in the C8 and C10 fields meet several additional criteria. Chief among them is a cutoff in the SDSS u-g vs. g-r color-color diagram, where dwarfs and giants diverge. This promises a yield well above the 3% achieved by SEGUE, and has a reduced bias towards low metallicity. The targets meeting these criteria have 16.2 <= Kp < 18.5. Follow-up spectroscopy is feasible with multi-object spectrographs in both hemispheres, but is not needed to determine temperatures, nor for a first estimate of metallicity.

By comparing the ugri colors of Castelli & Kurucz (2003) model atmospheres to the observed SDSS photometry of stars known to be giants, we have shown that the temperature of a red giant in a halo field of low reddening such as C8 and C10 is determined to 100K from its g-r color alone. Because nu_max is sensitive primarily to stellar surface gravity, its value as determined from K2 power spectra, coupled with Teff from g-r, sets the luminosity of the giant. Because giant luminosity at a given g-r is a function of stellar metallicity, this provides a reasonable estimate of [Fe/H] for each detected giant.

Relevance to the K2 solicitation and need for new K2 observations

Kepler 2 is the only means currently available that is capable of distinguishing red giants from dwarfs for hundreds of stars simultaneously over a wide field. The large field is necessary because cool red giants are very rare, as noted above. Although the Kepler field has produced many metal-poor giants, these are not in the remote halo because most are brighter than our magnitude limit and because the line of sight of the Kepler field skims the Galactic plane and does not reach far into the halo. Previous K2 halo fields include very few such faint stars with ugri photometry that indicates a potential cool giant. Consequently, this proposed work is responsive to the K2 solicitation for the halo fields C8 and C10."
GO10028,10,Billy,L,Quarles,SETI Institute,billy.l.quarles@nasa.gov,"Antoci, Victoria; Rowe, Jason Frank",The heat is on: exoplanets that orbit Hot stars,"Science Goals Objectives: The Kepler Mission has discovered a few thousand planet candidates, which has allowed for a statistical determination of planet size and orbital characterization.   In particular, multi-planet systems, where more than one planet is seen transiting a star have provided a wealth of information covering statistical confirmations, eccentricity distributions, mutual inclinations and dynamical stability.  We have learned that not only are planets plentiful, but are found in relatively flat and circular orbits.  However, this knowledge of the architecture exoplanetary systems is only currently valid for cooler G, K and M-dwarf stars, which were the prime targets from the original Kepler Mission.  From the Kepler Q1-Q12 catalogue there are only 116 planet-candidate systems where the host star has an effective temperature greater than 6500 K.  From this already small sample, only 18 have 2 or more known transiting candidates.  In stars with temperatures hotter than ~6500 K the stellar envelope structure and evolution on the main sequence is dominated by radiative transfer, opposed to cooler stars where convection plays an important role.   Misalignments between the planets orbital plane and stellar spin axis have been predominately found for stars with radiative atmospheres, whereas stars with convective envelopes typically show close alignment.  This observation is likely linked to the coupling of convective atmospheres and tidal forces.  As such, we wish to use K2 to determine the occurrence rate and orbital properties of multi-planet systems around hot stars.

Methodology: The Kepler Mission was a planet finding machine!  Our team has extensive knowledge and experience with Kepler photometric data for both transit finding and analysis as well as performing asteroseismic analysis of stars with temperatures greater than 6500 K.  We have selected approximately 400 target stars that fit within our target population and will ask for long-cadence (30 min) observations.  One of the problems of searching for planets around hotter stars is that many are known to pulsate (e.g. dSct and gDor type).  Fortunately, the pulsations can be identified, fitted and removed from a photometric light curves to allow searches for planets to reach low-noise levels.  Our plan is to use detrended photometric data and apply asteroseismic tools to remove stellar phenomena that may affect the data and to then search for transiting planets.  We will then study the properties of the planet-candidates using transit-depths, transit-durations and impact parameter to estimate the eccentricity and mutual inclination distributions, we will also estimate our planet search completeness and compare our measured properties to the properties of planetary systems found around cooler stars.

Relevance to Kepler-GO Program: Using space-based astronomical observations of star fields with K2 we will search for and characterize new planets around hot stars. Our research has the potential to determine whether the properties of the host star, convective or radiative atmospheres, play a role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.  We expect to apply for targets in future observing campaigns to make sure we find ample planetary systems around hot-stars to meet our research goals."

Like gas giant planets, very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs form condensate clouds in their atmospheres. K2 can uniquely characterize variability due to these clouds, both rotation modulation on a timescale of hours and weather evolution of the clouds on timescales from days to months. Magnetic activity changes dramatically at the stellar/substellar hydrogen-burning limits, but some ultracool dwarfs are known to flare. We will measure the white light flare rate in well-defined statistical samples as a function of effective temperature, rotation rate, and age. Flares are tied to magnetic reconnection rates and the energy budget. We also aim to detect transiting exoplanets by continuing to monitor each available ultracool dwarf in K2 campaigns; brown dwarfs, gas giants, and even large rocky planets are detectable.

Our goals are to discover pulsating variable stars, as well as eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars with variability produced by rotating spots or flares. We use BV and JHK colors and magnitudes listed in the EPIC catalog to select main-sequence stars with Kepler magnitudes between approximately 8 and 12.5. Our selection of stars in this magnitude range will minimize the number of pixels required, yet the stars will be bright enough for ground-based follow-up observations, including high-resolution spectroscopic observations.  The relative sparseness of these two fields near the South and North Galactic Cap will reduce the occurrence of contamination in the light curves from foreground/background stars sharing the same pixels.  Observations by the Kepler spacecraft have turned out to be ideal for discovery and characterization of main-sequence stars pulsating in radial and nonradial pressure and gravity modes. The long time series and high precision of the photometry have enabled determination of frequencies of modes with periods of order a day (g modes) to a few hours (p and mixed modes), and amplitudes as low as tens of parts per million using long-cadence data (30-min integrations per data point). Analysis of Kepler data has raised a number of questions about the possible pulsation driving mechanisms for gamma Doradus g-mode and delta Scuti p-mode pulsations, and revealed more hybrid star candidates (that show pulsations in both types of modes) than can be explained by present theories.  Kepler data have also been used to study slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars (g-mode pulsators), beta Cephei stars (p-mode pulsators) and their hybrids to test stellar pulsation theory in the presumably simpler case for these hotter stars with smaller inefficient envelope convection zones. The analysis has also revealed a number of apparently non-pulsating stars that lie within the pulsation instability regions established by theory that need to be explained. We expect to increase the numbers of these types of stars available for detailed study, especially for candidates brighter than those found in the original Kepler field. We also expect to discover additional eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars.  Our sample selection is not biased toward known pulsators, and includes enough stars to derive statistics on the occurrence of variability.  We will compare our results with similar surveys of stars in the original Kepler Cygnus-Lyra field, and with surveys of stars in young open clusters for K2 Fields 0, 4, 5, and 7.

For billions of years the Earth's shadow against the Sun has swept a path through space revealing our existence to the stellar neighbors that have passed within 0.26 degrees of the ecliptic.  We propose to survey all GKM dwarf stars within 1.0 degree of the ecliptic using the K2 spacecraft in order to identify transiting planetary systems that can mutually discover Earth via transit observations performed by another civilization in the last ~100,000 yrs.  This survey will significantly expand the number of ecliptic aligned planets known from the two Jupiter-class planets with 0.26 degrees of the current ecliptic (the hot-Jupiter, WASP-47b and the direct imaging, 5 Myr old 1RXS-J160929b) into the regime of Super-Earth size planets.

Methodology:
We will employ our extensive background in the analysis of Kepler data in order to search and provide a catalog of planet candidates from the K2 data within the ecliptic using tools and techniques developed for Kepler.  The primary goal is to generate a catalog of planet candidates for prioritization of SETI searches.  Secondary goals are to provide a well vetted sample of planet candidates to the community to follow up for asteroseismic or spectroscopic stellar characterization and radial velocity confirmation.

Relevance:
This study is proposing science targets for the K2 Campaign 8 and 10 fields.  Detection and characterization for transiting planets on the ecliptic cannot be accomplished with existing Kepler data as Kepler did not observe the ecliptic.  We estimate that ~1100 targets combining Campaign 8 and 10 targets will be proposed placing this proposal in the large proposal category."

Due to their diversity in fundamental properties (masses, luminosities, chemical compositions), RGB stars are ideal targets to tackle two key unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of host star mass, and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets. We propose to continue our survey of low-luminosity RGB stars (with radii between ~3.5-8 solar radii) to detect transiting gas-giant planets with K2 and address the above science questions by combining exoplanet transits and asteroseismology.

We have selected ~1400 targets for long-cadence observations using colors, reduced proper motions, and publicly available spectroscopic surveys. Planet candidates will be detected using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since RGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planet candidates.

The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing bright low-luminosity RGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

Space observations of RR Lyrae stars delivered an avalanche of discoveries including new dynamical phenomena that helped to study the internal structure and evolution of horizontal-branch stars. These objects are excellent galactic structure tracers and distance indicators, therefore understanding their dynamics is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. In this proposal we plan to study ~110 RR Lyrae stars in Field 8 and ~230 in Field 10 in long cadence and 5-5 in short cadence mode. The sample will be used to conduct galactic structure studies and to improve our understanding of the pulsational dynamics of RR Lyrae stars.

Research goals. 1. Study the Galactic structure and history by obtaining distances to RR Lyrae stars and determine their spatial distribution (halo streams, over-densities). During the K2 Mission we are building a unique database from field to field covering different parts of our Galaxy, to yield an unprecedented photometric RR Lyrae sample which will form the base of galactic structure studies and near-field cosmology. 2. Statistical analysis of various dynamical phenomena (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko-modulation, period-doubling, low-dimensional chaos, nonradial modes) and their occurrence rates to better understand their origin and their effect on distance determination. This can only be accomplished with K2. 3. Analyze in detail all RR Lyrae light curves, especially overtone and classical double-mode pulsators. The original Kepler field contained no double-mode RR Lyrae stars, and only a few overtone pulsators. In previous fields K2 observed 5 RRd and 24 RRc, but with Fields 8 &10 we will be able to increase their number by a factor of 2 and 3, respectively. This will aid the investigation of dynamical phenomena (resonances, mode interactions) that may be important in other types of pulsating stars, but can be best studied only in large-amplitude stars and with space photometry, and will also help to derive masses for RRd stars.

Methods. We produce light curves from target pixel data (PyKE and own software), then apply corrections, trend-filtering, outlier removal, etc. Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. Metallicities will be derived from empirical relations calibrated with high-resolution Keck/CFHT spectra. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations.
Targets. Approximately 100 and 230 RR Lyrae stars will be proposed (5-5 stars per field for short cadence observations). Although the RR Lyrae stars are faint due to their distances, the majority falling between 15 and 19 mag, where Kepler's precision is still high for these objects. 

Experience of team members. Our team consists of members of the Working Group#7 (RR Lyrae and Cepheids) of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, who have been working on Kepler data (also preparation and target selection) since the launch of the original mission. Our scientists are experts on data reduction, pixel photometry, light curve and time-frequency analysis, as well as theorists performing numerical hydrodynamical modeling. We developed dedicated software and routinely analyze Kepler and K2 data, and published 15+ Kepler RR Lyrae papers in high-impact journals. The group has access to ground-based follow-up (multi- color photometric and spectroscopic) instruments in Taiwan, Korea, USA, Canada and Hungary to complement space-based observations. We are currently finalizing two K2 papers featuring the first unambiguous detection of the Blazhko effect beyond the Magellanic Clouds, and a summary paper on RR Lyrae stars observed in the K2 Engineering Field."
GO10040,10,Adam,Gabriel,Jensen,University of Nebraska-Kearney,JensenAG@unk.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson; Redfield, Seth; Endl, Michael",Searching for Extended Exoplanetary Atmospheres Around Active Stars,"A key question in studying any planetary atmosphere is what happens at the boundary between the atmosphere and interplanetary space.  This unbound, outermost layer of an atmosphere is called its exosphere.  Several observations of extended atmospheres have been made (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Schlawin et al. 2010; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010, 2012; Fossati et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2012; Cauley et al. 2015, submitted) in hydrogen (both ground-state and excited) and various metals.

Our team detected excited, n=2 hydrogen (through hydrogen alpha absorption) in the exosphere of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012), the first such detection in an exoplanet atmosphere.  Follow-up observations (Cauley et al. 2015, submitted) confirmed this result by detecting exospheric absorption in hydrogen alpha, hydrogen beta, and hydrogen gamma, and also observed a significant pre-transit signal in these lines that is consistent with a bow shock leading the planet by several planetary radii.  Jensen et al. (2012) hypothesized that the excited hydrogen in the exosphere may be correlated with chromospheric activity, as HD 189733b, the only planet in that paper's sample of four planets to show H-alpha absorption, was also the most chromospherically active in the sample (as measured by S_HK and log [R'_HK] indices).

We propose to search for planets around stars which are candidates for chromospheric activity in the Kepler Campaign 8 and 10 fields.  The initial (but not exhaustive) basis for our target list is the tens of possible targets in the approximate fields listed in the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Survey's catalogue of chromospherically active stars (Zerjal et al. 2013).  Looking for planets around active stars with radial velocity methods is often disfavored because the stellar noise limits RV precision.  However, this makes the transit method the more important way to detect planets in these cases.  Furthermore, if any of these stars do have a transiting planet, they will be excellent potential candidates for follow-up spectroscopy with the large ground-based telescopes (Keck I, Hobby-Eberly Telescope) that our team has used in the past to detect exospheric absorption.  The goal of follow-up spectroscopic observations would be to search for excited hydrogen absorption from an exosphere, including possible pre-transit signals.  As a secondary science product, many of these active stars will have light curves worth studying on their own for stellar astrophysics purposes."
GO10041,10,Laszlo,,Molnar,Konkoly Observatory,molnar.laszlo@csfk.mta.hu,"Pal, Andras; Neilson, Hilding; Plachy, Emese; Szabo, Robert",Extragalactic Cepheids in the Local Group member IC 1613,"Research goals

IC 1613 is an isolated irregular dwarf galaxy within the Local Group. Thanks to its relative proximity (730 kpc), low foreground reddening, and the large number of Cepheid stars in it, it has been the subject of several studies during the past century (see, e.g. Sandage 1971, Bernard et al. 2010, and references therein). It played a key role in the discovery of the different stellar populations and the calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation.  

Although Cepheid stars have been extensively studied in the past, space photometric observations uncovered some new, puzzling details about them. Results from Kepler and MOST showed that significant jitter occurs in the light curve shape and period (Derekas et al. 2012, Evans et al. 2015). Some stars exhibit a low-amplitude additional modes of unknown origin. One mode in particular is strongly linked to the first overtone with a period ratio of ~0.6-0.64, across variable star classes (Moskalik 2014). This mode was first discovered in classical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and later in RR Lyrae stars too. We recently identified the same mode in the K2 observations of first-overtone galactic Cepheids. 

We expect that a significant portion of the IC 1613 sample will be measured accurately enough and long enough (for several pulsation cycles) that we will be able to search for the signs of period jitter and additional modes. The results will then be directly comparable to the K2 observations of Cepheids in the Milky Way. 

Targets

IC 1613 will be observable in its entirety during Campaign 8. It contains about 200 known Cepheids between 19 and 23 magnitudes in V, of which 30 are brighter than 21 magnitudes. The experiences with the faint trans-Neptunian objects (Pál et al. 2015) and with the RR Lyrae stars in the dwarf galaxy Leo IV (Molnár et al., in prep.) indicate that meaningful photometry can be extracted even for targets as faint as 21-23 magnitudes. The brightest stars pulsate with periods comparable with the campaign length (20-40 days), but most stars have periods shorter than 10 days and therefore several consecutive pulsation cycles will be observable. 

Beside the classical Cepheids, a few W Vir stars (Type-II Cepheids) are also known in the galaxy. Furthermore, an extended mosaic covering the area may also allow for extracting additional bright sources to explore other science cases.

Observing strategy and research team

Given the faintness of the targets, we propose to observe all targets in long cadence mode. Cepheids populate IC 1613 quite densely, compared to the resolution of Kepler. Their spatial distribution justifies tiling a large part of the galaxy with a continuous mosaic, instead of individual, potentially overlapping target pixel masks. Image subtraction techniques will be applied to extract the photometry of the faint but strongly variable stars. We will employ the same pipelines that we used to process the TNO and Leo IV targets.

Our team includes members of the KASC RR Lyrae and Cepheid Working Group, and consists of researchers who are experts in pixel photometry and crowded fields, light curve analysis, and hydrodynamic modelling of stellar pulsation. We routinely analyse Kepler and K2 data and have published multiple papers on related topics.

Success will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution. This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the solar neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.

RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.

AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (on average ~5000 per campaign) to probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys structure and evolution from its stellar populations.

METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use our seismic inferred stellar properties to stresstest state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."
GO10045,10,Elme,,Breedt,University of Warwick,E.Breedt@warwick.ac.uk,"Gaensicke, Boris Teddy; Steeghs, Daniel",Accretion disc variability in Cataclysmic Variables,"Accretion discs are a common occurrence in the universe. They exist on physical scales spanning orders of magnitude, ranging from the parsec scale discs which power active galactic nuclei to protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (few thousand km). The flow of material and angular momentum through these discs are governed by the same underlying physical processes, but timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion discs around cataclysmic variables (CVs) are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure and the effects of accretion rate variations, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Continuing our programme from campaigns 0 to 7, we propose to monitor the CVs and X-ray binaries in the K2 fields with the aim of building a library of high quality light curves that can be used to investigate disc-based phenomena. CVs and other accreting compact objects display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days). The unique capability of Kepler/K2 to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is key to understand accretion and accretion variability over such a wide range of timescales."

Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013). The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations. The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]). Given the extreme difficulty of measuring atmospheric properties of Earth-sized planets around solar-like stars, our first biomarker characterization of an Earth-sized planetary atmosphere, may come from an object transiting a white dwarf star. Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015). I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours. Even if no planets are detected for a significant sample of white dwarfs, an interesting constraint can be put on the population of such planets. 

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). 

Methodology: Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total. The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits. Additionally, the first planets detected were around a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992), so it may also be possible for white dwarfs to host planets. Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign. Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence. Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground. While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation. However, a follow-up campaign on known targets is quite straightforward. At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope. However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods. 

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO10049,10,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",Monitoring of Targets Within 100 Light Years,"Science Goals and Objectives: Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 light years provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres. A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets. It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come. I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 light years or 30.7 pc. A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons. This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes. This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques. Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars. While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges. A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable. 

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars). In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored. The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets. 

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability. An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003). One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium. This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint. Long cadence observations would be appropriate. 

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found. These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO10050,10,William,D.,Cochran,The University of Texas at Austin,wdc@astro.as.utexas.edu,"Shporer, Avi; Johnson, Marshall C",Probing the Planetary Population of High-Mass Stars,"Objectives: To date most planet searches have been confined to stars of spectral type F and later, as hotter stars have fewer spectral lines and tend to be rapidly rotating, making precise radial velocity (RV) observations difficult. By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiant stars in this mass range [1], but the masses of these stars have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus a number of planet candidates which are pending validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement subgiant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets and will be able to probe close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the subgiants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars, which currently number seven confirmed planets, too few to allow statistically significant investigations of this population. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2.

Targets: We plan to request approximately 100 long cadence targets, evenly divided between Fields 8 and 10. The sample will consist of A and early F-type dwarfs. We will propose for targets with 8<V<12.5, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: We will process the K2 data and search for planetary transit signals using PyKE. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory; we will leverage our group's experience with similar observations of Kepler prime mission targets. For long-period targets where the K2 observations are insufficient to constrain the transit parameters to the desired precision, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT). Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other techniques. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (an extension of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect to rapidly rotating stars, where the spectral line distortion during transit is spectroscopically resolved) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit. We are currently pursuing a program to validate Kepler prime mission candidates using Doppler tomography [5], and will use the same methodology for K2 candidates.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics Program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

A major result from surveys for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars.  This trend is not seen, however, around super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al 2013).  We propose to search a large sample of sub-solar metallicity stars in K2 GO Cycle 3 fields 8 and 10 for transiting planets of all sizes.  Stars in this metallicity range fall into three populations: the thin-disk (which also extends into super-solar metallicity), the thick-disk, and the halo (which extends to extremely metal poor stars). These three populations differ both kinematically and chemically.  Thick disk stars exhibit a larger vertical scale height in the galactic orbits, and they also show alpha-capture element abundances enhanced by about a factor of two over thin-disk stars.  Halo stars show even more extreme kinematics and also exhibit significant enhancement of alpha-capture elements.  The discovery of the Kepler-444 system (Campante et al 2015), which comprises five sub-Earth size planets orbiting an ancient (11.2 Gy age) thick-disk star with significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe=H]=-0.69 +/- 0.09 dex) shows that planet formation started very early in the history of the galaxy.  We will compute planet occurrence rates for stars as a function of stellar metallicity, stellar population and of planet radius.  For stellar metallicity, we will consider not just the standard [Fe/H] abundance, but also the abundance of the very important alpha-capture elements.  The goal of our program is to determine the characteristics of the first stars in our Galaxy to form potentially habitable planetary systems.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W. Cochran) and at KASI (led by Dr.  B.-C. Lee) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.  and will perform Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.

Targets:
We will propose a large sample of approximately 2000 targets.  Stellar metallicities range from [Fe/H]=-1.2 to solar. The stars range in V magnitude from 5.7 to 12.6, with most of the targets in the range 10 < V < 12. Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2015, MNRAS, 247, 2880) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 80 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems. These results will provide important new constraints on the physics and chemistry of planetary system formation, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."

Variability in the optical is observed at the 10% level in 99% of quasars. The cause of quasar variability is not known, but current theories suggest that the variations may be attributable to a combination of small-scale variations in the accretion disk viscosity that are triggered by localized dynamo processes, accretion disk instabilities, large scale fueling-rate variations, and complex oscillations of the accretion disk. Optical variability may be driven by X-ray variability which itself may be generated by flares in the accretion disk. Physical mechanisms for variability introduce causal correlation into the light curves of quasars i.e. it may be possible to probe the physical drivers of quasar variability by studying the correlation structure of their light curves.

One of the challenges in understanding the physics of quasar variability is that, while one can compute an average quasar spectral energy distribution, there is no ""standard"" quasar.  The diversity of quasars is seen not only in the range of their radio and X-ray properties, but also in their UV emission lines.  Exploring that diversity is the focus of this work and requires stacking analysis of a large number of faint, but luminous quasars at relatively high redshifts.

This diversity of UV emission-line properties in quasars can be characterized as considering broad emission line flux as having two origins with different relative contributions in each quasar: 1) a virialized component, and 2) a non-virial component, likely from radiatively-driven accretion-disk winds (Leighly 2004; Richards et al. 2011).  A key facet of such two-component models is that more luminous quasars are more likely to have a strong wind component (Murray et al. 1995; Proga 2000, 2003; Everett 2005).  This can be seen empirically in the emission line properties of quasars. 

Using these diagnostics, our group has recently demonstrated a bias in variability-based black hole mass estimates.  Black hole (BH) masses estimated from single-epoch spectroscopy underlie our understanding of the build-up of BHs from high redshift to the present, but are currently based on a small sample of low-L, low-z ""reverberation mapped"" (RM) AGNs (e.g., Kaspi et al. 2000; Vestergaard & Peterson 2006). We found that the existing sample of RM AGNs appears to be biased against quasars where a radiation line driven disk-wind dominates the broad emission line region (BELR).  Similar biases are expected to exist in the current Kepler/K2 sample.

Without a better understanding of differences in quasar variability across the diversity of quasar emission line properties, we will not be able to fully understand the physics of quasar variability.  To address this problem, we propose to observe 975 known (and candidate) luminous quasars with a mean redshift of z~1.5 -- such objects are far more likely to host winds than the typical AGNs studied by Kepler/K2 to date.  Stacking analysis of the quasars as a function of their known intrinsic properties will allow us to overcome the relatively short timescale of the K2 observing campaigns and will enable us to distinguish differences in the variability of quasars with and without strong winds.	Crucially 166 of our targets are in the so-called SDSS Stripe 82 area and already have up to 100 epochs of data over the course of 8 years.  The combination of these data with new K2 data would be an incredibly powerful tool for AGN variability analysis."

Perets et al. 2010 found a new class of faint events (Mv > -16) that were spectroscopically similar to SN Ib/c but have strong calcium lines in their nebular spectra. These objects, characterized by a relatively fast light curve (12 - 15 days to peak brightness),  are difficult to find by traditional surveys, and thus the progenitors of these interesting events are unknown.  In addition, Drout et al. 2014, using the Pan-STARRS1 survey, found a few transients that were relatively bright (-20 < Mv < -16) but with a time to maximum of only a few days. Even though they are bright, their short time scale, some brightening in only a day, causes these events to usually be missed. The stellar origin of these events is also unknown.

This program will be very sensitive to LBV- and nova-like eruptions, large amplitude flare stars, cataclysmic variable stars, and other still unknown types of faint, fast transients.

We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort (along with the main KEGS survey) to observe these galaxies every other day using SkyMapper and ATLAS Pathfinder. We will also coordinate multi- color photometry and spectra to classify the transients using PESSTO, and existing programs at Siding Spring, Lick, Gemini, and Keck."
GO10054,10,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,bod21@cam.ac.uk,"Queloz, Didier Patrick; Gillon, Michael; Huber, Daniel",Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types from M6 to L5, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such an exoplanet has not been discovered yet. As of today, K2 is the only facility that provides the required stability and photometric precision to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0 through 7 observations.

SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.

High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).

RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.

METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 8 and 10, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series. The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on the K2 C0-C2 data and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program.

EXPECTED YIELD. Our target list encompasses 86 targets in total for both campaigns.

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."

Due to the satellite's orbit, TESS will only be able to find potentially habitable worlds around the lowest mass M dwarfs (M < 0.3 Msun). To fully understand the planets around these M dwarfs, it is paramount to accurately characterize their host stars (i.e., determine their mass, radius, effective temperature, and metallicity). We propose to obtain K2 long-cadence data of four (4) known eclipsing binaries with an F or G-dwarf primary star and an M dwarf secondary star.  A full analysis of these unequal mass binaries allows for spectroscopic derivation of the temperature and metallicity of the primary star, and consequently the derivation of the mass and radius for both stellar components and the M-dwarf temperature.  K2 is the only means to acquire the full light curve for these objects, and its extremely high precision photometry allows for tight constraints on the radii of both components and more importantly the detection of the shallow secondary eclipses from which the secondary temperature is derived. Our measurements of the physical properties of the M dwarfs will better calibrate empirical and theoretical relationships at the bottom of the main sequence ultimately providing the best characterization of potentially habitable worlds discovered by TESS."

These deep transits also increase the potential for subsequent atmospheric characterization. The extended Kepler K2 mission provides the opportunity to monitor tens-of-thousands of nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise, long-cadence photometry and discover a new population of rocky and potentially habitable planets and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit spectroscopy. We propose to observe several thousand additional M dwarfs in the K2 campaign 8 and 10 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate hundreds of small planets around M dwarfs from the full K2-MDP program. This new population of planets will drastically increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems, improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected from the SUPERBLINK proper-motion database on the basis of high proper-motion and photometric colors. This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs within 100pc of the Sun from this deep (95% complete to V =19) catalog with little contamination. Our targets have median brightness Kp<16, most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC. We prioritize our targets using expected transit S/N, determined by comparing K2s photometric precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting super-Earth. We estimate transit depths by converting DSS, PanSTARRS 1, 2MASS, and WISE photometry to spectral type and then to radius and temperature. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity, and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date. The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward these goals and draws on considerable experience from Kepler. We have so far had successful target proposals in all previous K2 fields, have been awarded a 70-night ESO Large Program for spectroscopic follow-up of candidate planet hosts (PID 194.C-0443) along with dozens of nights of high-precision AO and RV followup at Lick, Palomar, LBT, and Keck.

Relevance: 
The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims to exploit the strengths of the K2 mission design to reveal hundreds of small planets around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-like planets and planets suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky planets and key transit spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) leading up to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; well before the launch of TESS.

The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak or completely absent discrete spectral features leaves us with only continuum variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F8 and F10 field of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of blazars with Kep magnitude < 18 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip that are not previously identified blazars. The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density on timescales from minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to lengthen the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies."

We plan to observe a sample of wide binaries spread across the K2 fields to constrain the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence and to provide benchmark systems for gyrochronology.

Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence. Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013).  In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star. Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity. Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars. 


Science Goal 2: Provide benchmark gyrochronology systems. Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components. 


By including wide binary components as Kepler targets, we will produce a valuable legacy product to test and recalibrate gyrochronology relations allowing the ages of field stars to be better constrained.

Target Selection. We will use the proper motion catalogue produced by Kraus et al. (2014) based on the methods of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007) including proper motions, estimated spectral types and distance moduli from SED fitting. We will select objects in both Fields 8 and 10 with significant (>5sigma) proper motions above 30mas/yr. From these we will select pairs of widely separated objects with common proper motion and distance.  To remove contamination due to coincident pairings of unrelated field stars, we will plot a histogram similar to the one we constructed for field 6 of pair separation. From this we will select pairs which lie in the region dominated by true physical pairs."
GO10060,10,David,Robert,Anderson,Keele University,d.r.anderson@keele.ac.uk,"Hellier, Coel; Southworth, John","Short-cadence lightcurves of WASP-107 and WASP-118: a sub-Saturn transiting a spotted star, and a hot Jupiter","For planets that transit across their host stars, we can use spectroscopy and photometry to measure planetary mass and radius. This leads to constraints on the planets' bulk compositions, internal structures, and formation and evolution histories. We recently discovered two transiting planet systems, WASP-107 and WASP-118, which will be on silicon during K2 campaigns 10 and 8, respectively. 

WASP-107b is a warm Saturn in a 5.7-day orbit around a K6 star and WASP-118b is a hot Jupiter in a 4.0-day orbit around an F6 star. Both stars are bright (V~11) and so are good targets for further study; indeed only 18 (13) Kepler exoplanet host stars are brighter than WASP-107 (WASP-118). As accurate and precise stellar and planetary dimensions require well-sampled transit lightcurves, we request short-cadence (SC) data. We have our own software proven capable of processing and analysing the data. 

It would be particularly interesting to know the bulk composition of WASP-107b. 
With a mass 2.2 times that of Neptune and 0.40 times that of Saturn, but a radius 0.94 times that of Jupiter, WASP-107b is in the transition region between ice giants and gas giants. This sets a lower limit on the planetary mass above which large gaseous envelopes can be accreted and retained by proto-planets on their way to becoming gas giants. WASP-107b will prove useful to planetary formation theory, which faces the challenge of explaining how ice giants avoid the runaway gas accretion that otherwise would have turned them into gas giants. 

By measuring the wavelengths of star-light preferentially scattered and absorbed by a transiting planet's atmosphere (transmission spectroscopy), we can infer the atmosphere's composition, and thus the planet's formation and evolution history. Due to the brightness of the host stars and the distended natures of the planetary atmospheres, both WASP-107 and WASP-118 are good targets for transmission spectroscopy.

Giant planets in few-day orbits, or 'hot Jupiters', are thought to have formed farther out and then migrated inwards. The pathway(s) via which hot Jupiters migrate are poorly understood, though we can rectify this by measuring the orbital obliquities of a range of systems. 

We will measure the sky-projected obliquity of WASP-118b with awarded spectroscopy time. With SC K2 data we will determine the inclination of the stellar spin axis and thus the orbital obliquity in three dimensions. WASP-107 rotates too slowly to measure obliquity via spectroscopy, but we are afforded an alternative opportunity due to the spottiness of the star. Its spottiness is evidenced by the periodic modulation of the WASP survey lightcurve and a spot-crossing event in a follow-up lightcurve. By measuring the times at which star spots are occulted by the planet over multiple transits, for which SC data are mandatory, we can infer the obliquity of the planet's orbit."

The majority of these observations were done with the CoRoT mission, a few have been monitored in Campaigns 0 and 2 of the K2 mission, and some will be observed during the upcoming Campaign 7. We aim to obtain a thorough understanding of their variability by increasing the sample with K2 data of higher quality than the Campaign 0 data. 

Hot stars show different types of stellar pulsations, which are classified according to the seismic properties, as well as the stellar properties of the star itself. The hottest of them (O stars) host  ² Cep pulsations, i.e. low order pressure and high order gravity  modes (see Aerts et al. 2010 for a monograph on asteroseismology). Slightly cooler (B type) stars show either g modes or, in case of fast stellar rotation, have rotationally enhanced stochastic oscillations (Neiner et al. 2012,A&A,546, A47). The cooler A stars are either roAp or ´ Scu types and show both p and g modes.

Seven percent of these OBA stars host magnetic fields detectable with current ground-based spectropolarimeters (Wade et al. 2014,IAUS,302,265). These fields are of fossil origin, i.e. remnants from the magnetic field of the molecular cloud from which the star formed, possibly enhanced by a dynamo during very early stages of stellar evolution. Fossil fields have simple configuration, often a dipole inclined compared to the rotation axis.

Combined magnetic and seismic information of hot stars is particularly interesting as it provides a unique way of probing the impact of magnetism on the physics of non-standard mixing processes inside these stars. Comparing the amount of mixing obtained by asteroseismic investigation for a sample of magnetic hot stars with that of a sample of non-magnetic objects would allow us to corroborate that magnetic fields inhibit mixing in stellar interiors, as predicted by several theoretical criteria (e.g. Spruit 1999,A&A,349,189) and observed for V2052 Oph (Briquet et al. 2012,MNRAS,427,483). Additionally, the magnetic field can influence the stellar oscillations by, e.g., magnetic mode splitting (Aerts et al. 2010).

Up to now, asteroseismic modelling has been performed for only two magnetic pulsating B stars (Shibahashi & Aerts 2000,ApJ,531,143; Briquet et al. 2012) and a few A stars (e.g. Kurtz et al. 2014,MNRAS,44,102). Although magnetic fields have been detected in a number of other pulsating hot stars, there is no seismic modelling available for them due to the lack of asteroseismic data. 

While combining asteroseismology with spectropolarimetry opened the way to a reliable exploration of the effects of magnetism on the physics of mixing inside stellar interiors of hot stars, we now need to investigate a larger sample of magnetic targets. We intend to progress by observing known magnetic hot stars with K2. Given the rarity of such objects, the upcoming K2 campaigns complemented by spectropolarimetric follow-up will be instrumental to increase the number of asteroseismic studies of magnetic hot stars.

The photometric accuracy and the high duty-cycle of K2 makes the mission best suited to reach our science goals. State-of-the-art modelling tools will translate the seismic information to detailed stellar models. Spectropolarimetric observations will be obtained with ESPaDOnS or Narval.  Our team members already worked together under the MASSIVE consortium and the gathered expertise will be optimal to study the targets in d Fields 8 and 10.  Only two hot magnetic Ap stars are observable in Fields 8 and 10, one in each field. This includes one in a close binary system which could host interacting magnetospheres, testing the effects of magnetism on binarity, and vice versa. Although the proposed targets might show variability on short timescales, we can work with long cadence data to study the low order p modes and all possible g modes, as demonstrated by Saio et al. 2015 (MNRAS,444,3264)."

	Widely used in the asteroseismology of red giants, asteroseismic scaling relations connect stellar properties such as masses and radii to easy-to-derive seismic parameters such as the frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation. Although scaling relations do have some theoretical justification, they are still mostly based on the only star whose parameters we truly know: the Sun. The precise seismic K2 observations coupled with high-quality ground-based interferometric and spectroscopic data of bright nearby giants will allow us to subject the scaling relations to the most demanding tests. 
	The second application is to constrain the poorly understood mixing processes working inside red giants, such as thermohaline mixing, rotation, and deep circulation. These processes are predicted to have different impact at different stages of red giant evolution, and to leave imprints in the surface chemical composition of a star. Precise seismic log (g) from K2 time series, coupled with high resolution spectroscopy, will allow for a detailed abundance determination of a large number of chemical species. The correlations between elements (e.g. [C/ Fe] vs [N/ Fe]) and departure from their theoretically predicted values (as in the case of Li or 12 C/13 C) are tracers of internal mixing processes, and will be studied as a function of the seismically determined mass. 
	The third goal of this proposal is to address one of the biggest uncertainties in stellar astrophysics: the abundance of helium in stars. The helium second ionization zone inside a star produces an abrupt change in the local sound speed, which is detectable in the Fourier spectrum of time series as a periodic variation. We will construct detailed models of red giants where this variation is detected, and coupled with independent constraints on angular diameter and detailed surface composition, we will put stringent constraints on the helium abundance of red giants and test our assumptions on enrichment laws of the Galaxy. 
	We have selected ~40 bright (Kp~5-8) red giants which are ideally suited for this project due to their precisely determined distances, large angular sizes for interferometry, and detectable oscillations in the 80 day K2 baseline. Red giants observed by Kepler were generally too faint to meet these criteria, making K2 uniquely suited to perform these observations. Our proposal addresses compelling questions in stellar structure and evolution, and is hence directly related to the K2 GO solicitation."

We request further K2 monitoring of new X-ray sources in the Campaigns 8 and 10 fields discovered with our ongoing Kepler-Swift Active Galaxies Survey (KSwAGS) to probe accretion onto compact objects at a variety of scales. The first phase of the KSwAGS survey uncovered 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., in preparation). Approximately half of these sources were indeed active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various types (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring M-stars). High precision optical follow-up would be scientifically useful for all sources; however, the fourth Kepler reaction wheel failed before we could propose Kepler monitoring of the new X-ray targets. We successfully received time for K2 to monitor KSwAGS sources in Field 4, and are awaiting the data currently. This proposal is therefore the second in our rolling plan to survey K2 Fields with Swift, and follow up with K2 optical monitoring.

Previous AGN in the original Kepler field were selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012). These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 108 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum is dominated by starlight rather than AGN light (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2012). Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be constrained by a 75-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks. This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk). This further monitoring will critically enhance the sample numbers of K2-monitored AGN discovered using a relatively unbiased selection method.

Methodology
We aim to use Keplers unprecedented photometric precision to detect characteristic variability timescales using Fourier analysis, which is far superior to the structure function analysis that must be used on ground-based light curves. These timescales are the only possible direct observables of AGN accretion physics, which remains an important astrophysical mystery.  Additionally, these X-ray selected targets will fill in the phase-space of black hole mass and accretion rate, complementing our work in the original Kepler field.


Relevance of Proposed Research
Our KSwAGS project has been assigned high priority status by the Swift team, and should begin surveying 1 module each in the K2 Campaigns 8 and 10 FOVs in July 2015. We anticipate ~50 sources based on the detection rate in previous KSwAGS fields. The photometric precision of K2 will be more than adequate for our scientific purposes."

Analyses of data provided by the NASA's Kepler mission has revolutionized this field by compiling a statistically significant number of transiting planets and planetary candidates, providing  time series data for a large sample of systems that can be utilized in consistent comparative studies (e.g. Angerhausen et al., 2015).

One promising new way to further characterize some of these transiting systems are methods using ground-based multi-object spectrographs for transit and eclipse spectrophotometry such as GMOS in the optical (e.g. Stevenson et al., 2014; Huitson et al., 2015, in prep.) or MOSFIRE in the infrared (e.g. Crossfield et al., 2013; Morris et al, 2015, subm.).  These emerging ground-based methods allow access to larger apertures and better time-sampling of transit lightcurves than equivalent HST methods. They therefore have the potential to observe transits at the precisions achievable from space but at a fraction of the cost and with the possibility of repeated measurements in wavelength bands not available from space until the start of JWST. 

However, most of the planets found by the Kepler telescope have host stars that are too faint to be followed up with spectrophotometric techniques even with space based platforms such as Hubble or Spitzer. The ground-based methods are even further constrained by the need for similarly bright comparison stars in close neighborhood to the observed host star of the transiting system. In order to reduce instrumental systematics and optimize the time-sampling needed for transit atmosphere observations, the comparison stars must be bright, of similar magnitude to the exoplanet host star and be within a few arcmin.

To identify ideal candidates for ground-based characterization studies, we therefore we propose to use the single, visible wavelength instrument on board of K2 to obtain high-precision long cadence photometry on of the best suited 500 pairs of similarly bright stars (mag < 12, separation < 5 arcmin). Assuming an occurrence of well-vetted planet candidates with P d 30 d of about ~2%, we expect to find ~20 systems that will be accessible for spectrophotometric follow up from the ground.

The goal of high precision time resolved photometry is to reduce or in the best case remove all noise to achieve photon-noise limited photometry. After years of experience with these data a number of best practices for their handling have emerged: For the reduction and preparation of K2 data as well as for the planet search in the reduced data, we have access to a number of standard procedures that are already widely used in the community (e.g. the PyKe tools,  Barclay & Still 2012;  K2 specific best practices, Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015; or SIP, Angus et al. 2015).  

Finding these extremely valuable targets will enable us to do exactly the kind of basic research that advances our knowledge by characterization of planets and planetary systems outside of our Solar System in order to determine their compositions, dynamics, energetics, and chemical behaviors. The proposed study will directly support NASAs goal to Discover and study planets around other stars, in order to understand the underlying physical processes of exoplanets and to improve understanding of their origins."
GO10068,10,David,,Charbonneau,Harvard University Dept of Astronomy,dcharbonneau@cfa.harvard.edu,"Vanderburg, Andrew; Buchhave, Lars A; Lopez-Morales, Mercedes; Latham, David W.; Dressing, Courtney D; Dumusque, Xavier; Johnson, John Asher",Characterizing Small Planets with K2 and HARPS-N,"Follow-up studies of the small planets detected by Kepler have revealed a remarkable diversity of planet densities, indicating that predicting planetary properties from a radius measurement alone could lead to significant errors in our estimate of the frequency of rocky (and possibly habitable) worlds. We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2 and conducting follow-up high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models. 

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date (Fields 0-7) is small. 

We propose a ranked list of 8023 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We will search for all V < 12 stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 8 and 10, which are accessible to HARPS-N. We will then use the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. 

We will identify promising planet candidates in K2 photometry using the planet detection pipeline developed by team members Vanderburg and Johnson. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities. 

The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 80 nights per year of guaranteed time per year. The follow-up of small planets from Kepler and K2 is the top scientific priority of HARPS-N. PI D. Charbonneau is chair of the HARPS-N Science Team and the Target Selection Team. 

We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves, reconnaissance imaging, and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. 

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a tremendous impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful background information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."
GO10069,10,David,W,Hogg,New York University,david.hogg@nyu.edu,"Foreman-Mackey, Daniel; Price-Whelan, Adrian M","The search for ""extragalactic"" exoplanets in the Sagittarius stream","The proposed pointing for Campaign 8 of the K2 Mission presents an unprecedented opportunity to discover and characterize planets transiting stars belonging to the Sagittarius stellar stream (Sgr stream). The Sgr stream is a well-studied tidal debris structure that wraps around the entire Milky Way and is detected in many different stellar populations (from main sequence to M and K giant stars). The nearest sections of the stream visible in Field 8 span a range of distances from 10-30 kpc, closer than satellite galaxies around the Milky Way but still many times the distance of the farthest known transiting exoplanets. Even at these distances, K2 will be able to easily observe giant stars.

We have developed a method for exoplanet transit search using K2 data that resulted in the publication of the first systematic catalog of transit candidates based on a K2 data release. This method can robustly detect transiting exoplanets despite the large systematic variability introduced by the diminished pointing precision of the Kepler spacecraft and it is reasonably complete to faint apparent magnitudes (Kp ~ 17-18 mag).

We propose to target the brightest (~100) Sgr stream member stars in Campaign 8 of the K2 Mission and, using our transit detection procedure, search the light curves for large planets transiting these giant stars. These signals will be small and the light curves will be noisy, therefore robust noise modeling will be crucial for transit signal discovery. While the chance of discovering a transiting planet belonging to the Sgr stream is low, the cost is low and the discovery of even a single transiting planet of extragalactic origin would be exciting."
GO10070,10,Ed,,Shaya,U. of Maryland,eshaya@umd.edu,"Olling, Robert P; Rest, Armin; Kasen, Daniel Nathan; Garnavich, Peter M.; Tucker, Brad E; Mushotzky, Richard",The K2 Extragalactic Survey (KEGS) for Transients,"Supernovae (SN) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) vary on timescales of hours to months and are still shrouded in mystery. We propose a Large K2 Program to monitor ~2000 bright (r < 18 mag, z < 0.1) galaxies in Campaign 8 and ~2600 in Campaign 10 which should yield 12 - 24 great light curves (LCs) of supernovae. To date, we have identified 6 supernovae in Kepler GO programs (3 Type Ia and 3 Type II, although one may be Type IIn/Ia-csm), and we also found that ~ 4% of our galaxies display AGN activity (Shaya et al 2015) (variable at > 0.001% level). We plan to: a) determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe using features in the early breakout (t < 4 days) LCs; b) explore the explosion physics of SN, especially SN Ia, using subtle features during their rise (t < 20 days); c) improve the calibration of SN Ia as standard candles for measuring distances, Ho, and dark energy using K2 LCs of unprecedented detail; d) in nearby galaxies, look for fast (t < 10 day) and faint (Mv > -15) transients in a new range of parameter space provided by K2; and e) add significant knowledge to the virtually unexplored very low-Eddington regime of AGN. 

There is an ongoing controversy over the basic physics of one of the key tools in cosmology, the SN Ia standard candle. Do SNe Ia gradually reach critical mass via accretion from a companion star or does it merge with another WD? If a white dwarf had been accreting mass from a companion star, as the ejecta reaches the companion a shock would form with observable optical emission (Kasen 2010). The emission would be short lived and strongest from certain viewing angles, requiring rapid cadence for several SNe before definitive conclusions can be reached. For the 3 SN Ia discovered by Kepler monitoring of ~500 galaxies (Olling et al. 2015), no companions were indicated and tight constraints were placed. With a larger sample, we could determine the statistics for the two possible channels that trigger SN Ia. Meanwhile, features due to the different explosion physics (detonation, deflagration, inwards-moving diffusion waves, etc) of Ia and core collapse SNe will also be revealed. K2 will allow for the first time to test models more complicated than simple ""expanding fireballs."" 

Our program will improve the calibration of SN Ia's for distance measurements. By determining correlations among the key parameters needed for distance fitting (light-curve width, maximum, and the explosion time) on the scale of minutes rather than days, this program will improve the precision of distances and hence the values of Ho and dark energy as a function of redshift. 

We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe the entire field every other day using SkyMapper and ATLAS Pathfinder. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify discovered transients using PESSTO, and existing programs at Siding Spring, Lick, Gemini, and Keck. These data, coupled with high precision 30 minute K2 data will have enormous legacy value. 

In addition this program will also be sensitive to LBV- and nova-like eruptions, tidal shredding of stars or other material by super-massive black holes, and other still unknown types of faint, fast transients in the nearer galaxies of our sample. 

Methods: 
We are exploring techniques to detrend sensitivity changes over the short (daily) and long terms (months). We use correlations of brightness with centroid position and width similar to the kepsff tool of the Pyke Software suite and are creating Cotrending Basis Vectors based on our target galaxies. Both methods can be applied to the quiet time before a SN event and then extrapolated passed the onset. For AGN, we use the minimum number of CBVs that eliminate the instrumental noise but leave physical variations intact.

E.",New Algol Candidates for Investigating Gas Stream Dynamics in Interacting Binary Systems,"The K2 mission and the modeling capabilities of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary system analysis program present a unique opportunity to probe gas stream dynamics and/or magnetic activity from the recently discovered brightness variations in Algol binaries that we call L/T (Leading/Trailing hemisphere) variables. The L/T phenomenon was discovered in Kepler data and has never been reported in ground-based photometry. L/T behavior is likely due to changes in either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the impact site's location and movement can be diagnostic of stream dynamics that may be modulated by magnetic fields. In the cool spot scenario the variability is a consequence of magnetic activity on the mass loser. We propose K2 observations in the LC mode of 10 Algol systems in Fields 8 and 10 to expand our study of mass transfer dynamics and the importance of magnetic fields.  In K2 Cycle 3 we are extending our study to close eclipsing systems with periods less than 1.0  day to investigate whether enhanced tidal interaction has influence on the L/T ratio and behavior. The Kepler and K2 databases are deficient in observations of very short-period Algols.  Modeling the K2 light curves with the WD program, stellar and spot parameters, including spot motions, will be determined so as to generate a virtual image of the binary versus time. This project will yield information on the detailed physics of mass transfer, especially the roles of accretion hot spots and magnetic fields. The updated WD program will be made available for future applications by others working with the Kepler/K2  databases."
GO10075,10,Csaba,,Kiss,Konkoly Observatory,pkisscs@konkoly.hu,"Szabo, Gyula M; Molnar, Laszlo; Pal, Andras; Szabo, Robert",Rotational properties of selected transneptunian objects in the Kepler K2 C8 & C10 campaigns,"The light curves of transneptunian objects (TNOs) hold information on the formation and evolution of the small bodies in the Solar System, as it is outlined in our White Paper, presented to the GO Office in the early phase of the K2 mission. Our recent study of the TNOs 2002 GV31 and 2007 JJ43 has shown (Pal et al., 2015) that the Kepler K2 mission can be very effectively used for TNO light curve observations. Here we propose to study light curves of a selected set of TNOs in the K2 C8 and C10 campaigns with an optimised observing strategy. 

A part of our targets have available thermal infrared data from Herschel Space Observatory measurements (Müller et al., 2009), with accurate size and geometric albedo values. This is important in resolving the size and absolute albedo ambiguity of the light cur e inversion techniques (Kaasalainen et al. 2001). These methods are able to reconstruct the shape and/or the surface albedo variegations based on the observed visual range light curve, however, the same shape and/or relative albedo distribution can be produced by objects of different size and median albedo combinations. With the synergy of Herschel and Kepler K2 light curve observations we will be able to obtain a comprehensive picture of these objects. 

The other set of objects in our proposed study are TNOs in mean motion resonance 
with Neptune. Resonant objects are extremely valuable since these objects were likely captured into these resonances during the outward migration of Neptune. Physical characteristics of these objects can constrain evolutionary scenarios of the Solar System as different resonances swept up or captured objects from different initial locations. The rotational characteristics are one of these important constraints. 

The first trans-Neptunian objects in the K2 mission have been observed with long, thin pixel mosaics covering the entire arc of the orbit around the stationary point. 
While this method undoubtedly provides the largest amount of data from a single 
target, it is not the most optimal in terms of pixel budget per target. Targets farther from the stationary points the exhibit quadratically increasing proper motions leading to excessive pixel requirements. About 7000 pixels were used in Campaign 2 to cover the path of 2007 JJ43, yet a small gap around the stationary point meant that 21 days of data were still lost. In contrast, 2002 GV31 was observable for 16 days during Campaign 1 with a single mask that contained only 500 pixels. We propose to maximize the scientific return of the K2 TNO program by allocating smaller masks (1500-1800 pixels) for multiple targets per campaign. The positive detection of 2002 GV31 indicates that 20-30 day-long observations around the stationary point may allow us to reliably determine the rotation periods and amplitudes of targets as faint as 23 magnitudes. Pixel masks can be further optimized if they are not centered on the stationary point which is the westernmost point of their proper motion during the observing run, but shifted slightly towards east (by 5-10 pixels).

PG1159 is a hot, young white dwarf that exhibits multi-mode pulsations with periods of hundreds to thousands of seconds and amplitudes of order 1%. The precise period of pulsation of each mode depends in part of the radius and temperature profile of the star. The star is cooling and contracting rapidly, and we can detect its evolution from the change in pulsation period on timescales of a few decades. Costa et al. (2008, A&A 489, 1225) succeeded in measuring the rate of cooling and contraction of this star based on observations spanning 20 years. K2's continuous observations will add to this baseline and measure the rate of evolution with unprecedented precision. These improved measurements can be compared to asteroseismic models to better understand the internal properties of the star, including the rate of chemical stratification, and the emission rates of neutrinos in hot plasmas.

This proposal is consistent with the K2 proposal requirement of addressing a compelling scientific question in the field of stellar astrophysics."

The first of our three objectives is construct catalogs of transiting planets in the magnitude-limited samples of K2 fields.  These catalogs enable diverse follow-up observations and analyses by our team and others.  Second, we aim to discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  Our third goal is to use the planet catalogs to measure variations in the occurrence rate of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood. We already see differences between the populations of planets orbiting nearby stars and stars in the prime Kepler Field.  For example, hot Jupiters are 2.5 times less abundant in the Kepler Field (Howard et al. 2012).  We have to wonder if the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone (Petigura et al. 2013) is similarly reduced relative to nearby stars. With this proposal we will measure the occurrence of detectable, short-period super-Earths and Neptune-size planets (~2-3 Earth-radii). 


This Cycle 3 request for Campaigns 8 and 10 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in C0-C7 (PIs Howard, Sanchis-Ojeda, Petigura, and Winn) that constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.  We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts.  Here we request magnitude-limited samples (Kp < 14) of Fields 8 and 10 comprising 8971 and 8443 stars, respectively.

We will continue our search for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013).  We catalog the planets discovered, their orbital and physical properties, and their host star characteristics.  We compute the occurrence rates of small, close-in planets using injection-and-recovery tests to account for the sensitivity of TERRA and will report the field-to-field variability and overall rates of planet occurrence. Assuming a precision of 80 ppm over 6.5 hours, a 2 Earth-radii planet with P = 20-day is detectable at SNR = 8 during a single 75-day K2 campaign.  Based on the prime mission occurrence statistics, we expect to find 3 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with P < 20 days per 1,000 stars observed. As validated by our searches of K2 photometry from Campaigns 0-2, a sample of 8,000 stars is expected to yield ~25 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with orbital periods less than 20 days, providing an occurrence measurement with 25% fractional uncertainty. With 8,000 stars, we will be sensitive to factor-of-two variations in the occurrence rate of 2-3 Earth-radii planets at 4-sigma significance.  In addition, we will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES and other facilities. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultra-short-period Earths. Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission.

This proposal directly addresses two objectives from the prime Kepler mission: measuring planet occurrence rates and characterizing small planets with Doppler mass measurements."

These parts (the bulge, thick disk, thin disk, halo) feature distinct stellar populations, and understanding the properties of those populations is an ongoing effort. Studying these properties relies on reliable fundamental parameters of stars: their masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities. Eclipsing binary stars lend themselves naturally to this task, since their favorable geometrical orientation and basic laws of gravity enable us to determine fundamental parameters to a ~1% accuracy. We scoured the published catalogs and proprietary KELT and SuperWASP data for all eclipsing binary stars in K2 C11, C12 and C13 fields. We propose to observe these stars and, along with other serendipitous discoveries of binarity in the fields, build a stellar population model based on the fundamental parameters derived from K2 data and follow-up multi-color photometry and spectroscopy.

At the start of K2 we initiated a project to observe a stars with M/L spectral type to determine how the flare activity depends on parameters such as mass, rotation period, age and hence a better understanding of the
underlying physics which produce flares. A second key goal is to assess how correlated flares are with the stellar rotational phase. Kepler observations indicate that at least some flare stars do not show a correlation but do show a characteristic rotational modulation. This is difficult to explain since the modulation is expected to be due to starspots rotating into and out of view which should produce a correlation between phase and flare rate. Our work will also have implications for determining how flares can effect the atmosphere of any exoplanets in the stellar system. Our target selection will cover the M (and early L) spectral types. We bid for observatios of 4, 3 and 10 known flare stars in Fields 11, 12 and 13 respectively.

Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy.

Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012). For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission.

The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars.

Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem.

Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013).

Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. Several hundred of them (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields from 2014 to 2017. We have successfully applied for time in previous campaigns and the lightcurves for campaigns 0-5 are fully analysed, paper close to submission (Stelzer et al., A&A). For fields 11-13, observed in late 2016 and early 2017, we propose to include ~100 targets in the K2 fields for these campaigns for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them will fall onto the Kepler chips. For the subsequent fields we will submit similarly sized numbers of objects. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner using the procedures developed for previous campaigns."

This will be achieved using short-cadence (SC) data collected during K2 Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 (C11-13). The information contained in solar-like oscillations allows the internal stellar structure to be constrained to unprecedented levels, and allows precise determinations of fundamental stellar properties (e.g., mass, radius, and age). We seek to exploit the unique opportunity offered by K2 to observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed during the nominal mission, thus benefiting from better independent constraints (from, e.g., parallaxes, spectroscopy, interferometry, etc.). This will make it possible to bring the full potential of asteroseismology to bear to test the physics of stellar interiors. To constrain our analysis further we plan for a spectroscopic follow-up of the proposed targets. By combining the targets observed during C11-13 with those from previous K2 campaigns that possess independent constraints we may calibrate seismic scaling relations. This will be essential in seismic galactic archaeology studies, which rely on the application of these relations. Including also targets from the nominal mission, we may study the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood and place constraints on the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars. The results will be used in ongoing investigations that are relevant to this solicitation:
-In C13 we propose to observe several members of the Hyades open cluster, where we intend to obtain independent constraints from interferometry with CHARA, and for the brightest targets simultaneous RV observation with the SONG telescope network. We have successfully detected solar-like oscillations in two Hyades stars observed during C4; adding to this with targets from C13 with independent constraints will greatly help our ongoing analysis of the Hyades.
-The targets will further expand the sample of benchmark stars having precise fundamental properties from asteroseismology to different fields in the Galaxy, which will be crucial to calibrate upcoming large surveys such as Gaia and GALAH. The use of results from our asteroseismic analysis of targets from C1-3 have already been requested by the Gaia-ESO team to help calibrate their astrophysical parameters data reduction pipeline.
-The availability of precise asteroseismic ages of stars with detectable surface rotation periods will provide additional constraints for gyrochronology.
-Asteroseismology will allow us to better characterize targets with detected exoplanets, including both new detections made by K2 and known exoplanet-host stars on our list.

We estimate requesting for 40-50 targets per campaign. These should show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes, hence SC data are required for detecting the oscillations. We will prepare analysis-ready light curves from pixel-data using in-house software - these will be made available to the community via the KASOC portal. Next, we will apply well-tested analysis procedures to the frequency-power spectra of the light curves, providing both estimates of global seismic parameters and parameters describing individual modes of oscillation. Detailed frequency modelling using state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes will then provide the stellar properties. The methodology delineated above has already been successfully applied to the analysis of K2 C1-5 data, for which we reached a very good understanding of the asteroseismic detection yield. From C3-5 data we have found that solar-like oscillations can be detected for stars similar to the Sun, with characteristic frequencies around 3100 micro Hertz. We have also successfully extracted individual frequencies for these stars, hence enabling detailed seismic modelling."
GO11014,11,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,"Rotation rates and ages of stars in wide binary systems, and a search for hierarchical triples in Kepler K2 campaigns 11-12-13","Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and presumably have very similar chemical compositions. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated, which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are. Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 11, 12, and 13, we have identified a total of 180 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 60. Our statistical analysis indicates that about 90% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignment of unrelated stars). Half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. A majority of the secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, many pairs can be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target (or may use fewer pixels overall). One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, which means that a significant fraction of wide binaries may actually be hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or eclipsing) binary star; this prediction will be directly tested with K2, by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries in those pairs."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is known about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. Our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed by K2 in campaigns 11, 12, and 13 identifies 2,604 high-velocity subdwarfs that are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, in order to identify and characterize the first generations of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will be complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."

Low-mass M dwarfs provide the highest probability of detecting small (<0.5  4 R_E) transiting
planets by virtue of the large transit depths seen for such small stars. These deep transits also
increase the potential for subsequent atmospheric characterization. The extended Kepler K2 mission
provides the opportunity to monitor tens-of-thousands of nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise,
long-cadence photometry and discover a new population of rocky and potentially habitable planets
and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit spectroscopy. We propose to observe several
thousand additional M dwarfs in the K2 campaigns 1113 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our
successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate dozens to
hundreds of small planets around late-type stars from the full K2-MDP program. This
new population of planets will drastically increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems,
improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and
atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected from the SUPERBLINK proper-motion database on the basis of
high proper-motion and photometric colors. This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs
within 100pc of the Sun from this deep (95% complete to V =19) catalog with little contamination.
Our targets have median brightness Kp<16, most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC.
We prioritize our targets using expected transit S/N, determined by comparing K2s photometric
precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting super-Earth. We estimate transit
depths by converting DSS, PanSTARRS 1, 2MASS, and WISE photometry to spectral type and
then to radius and temperature. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light
curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate
planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity,
and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring
for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host
characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf
planets to date. The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward these goals and
draws on considerable experience from Kepler. We have so far had successful target
proposals in all previous K2 fields, have been awarded large, multisemester programs
at ESO (for spectroscopic follow-up), Keck (for Radial Velocity masses), and Gemini
(for AO and speckle imaging).


Relevance

The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims
to exploit the strengths of the K2 mission design to reveal hundreds of small planets
around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-like planets and planets
suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky planets and key transit
spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) leading up
to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; well before the launch of TESS.

Our goals are to discover pulsating variable stars, as well as eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars with variability produced by rotating spots or flares, and develop statistics on the occurrence of variability.  This proposal complements observations taken for our previous K2 GO Cycle 1, 2, and 3 proposals, as each K2 field samples different stellar populations in the Galactic disk, halo, spiral arms, and young clusters near the ecliptic plane.  We use B-V and J-K colors and magnitudes in the EPIC catalog to select main-sequence stars with Kepler magnitudes between 6 and 16.  The Kepler signal-to-noise level is high enough to identify variability in even the faintest proposed targets, and many of these stars will be bright enough for ground-based follow-up observations, including high-resolution spectroscopic observations for pulsation mode identification.  The survey will also be useful to identify promising targets for current or future space-based observations by, e.g., TESS, PLATO, or BRITE.

Observations by the Kepler spacecraft have turned out to be ideal for discovery and characterization of main-sequence stars pulsating in radial and nonradial pressure and gravity modes. The long time series and high precision of the photometry have enabled determination of frequencies of modes with periods of order a day (g modes) to a few hours (p and mixed modes), and amplitudes as low as tens of parts per million using long-cadence data (30-min integrations per data point). Analysis of the Kepler data has raised a number of questions about the possible pulsation driving mechanisms for gamma Doradus g-mode and delta Scuti p-mode pulsations, and revealed an unexpectedly large number of hybrid star candidates that show pulsations in both types of modes. The Kepler data have also been used to study slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars (g-mode pulsators), beta Cephei stars (p-mode pulsators) and their hybrids to test stellar pulsation theory in the presumably simpler case for these hotter stars with smaller inefficient envelope convection zones. The analysis has also revealed a number of apparently non-pulsating stars that lie within the pulsation instability regions established by theory that need to be explained. We expect to increase the numbers of these types of stars available for detailed study, especially for candidates brighter than those found in the original Kepler field. We also expect to discover additional eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars. 

Our sample selection is not biased toward known pulsators, and includes enough stars to derive statistics on the occurrence of variability.  We will compare our results with similar surveys of stars in the original Kepler Cygnus-Lyra field as well as K2 Fields 6, 8, and 10, and with surveys of stars in open clusters for K2 Fields 0, 4, 5, and 7.  We will also extend the time series of observations for some Hyades cluster stars observed in the K2 Field 4 that are also observable in Field 13.  We will produce a catalog of the candidate variables, eclipsing binaries, and magnetically active stars that we find.

Although we are proposing to observe several thousand targets (large proposal), our budget request will be $50K (small-proposal limit) for the PI to oversee the project, prepare the catalog, and present results in journal papers and at conferences."

Carbon stars may be responsible for at least half the dust returned to the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) (e.g., Jura & Kleinmann 1989, Gehrz 1989). However, while progress has recently been made linking the dust production and mass loss of these stars to their long-term pulsations, little is known about their high-frequency oscillations. Most of the work so far has concentrated on the oxygen-rich sample of evolved stars (e.g., Banyai et al. 2013, 2014). To fill this void, we will use K2 to observe the evolved carbon stars in the next three campaigns. K2 enables us to to bypass a basic problem in Galactic astronomy: the unknown distances to Galactic carbon stars. With K2 data, the asteroseismologic techniques and models that have been developed for oxygen-rich stars (e.g., Chaplin & Miglio 2013) can be applied to the carbon stars in order to determine their fundamental parameters like mass, radius, and surface gravity - independent of their unknown distances. Thus, a small investment of K2 time, 29 long-cadence observations, has the potential for a very high
scientific payoff."
GO11022,11,Philip,Steven,Muirhead,Boston University,philipm@bu.edu,"Skinner, Julie N; Croll, Bryce",Activity and Planets at the Bottom of the Main-Sequence,"We propose to observe a carefully selected sample of ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs) with K2 during Campaigns 11, 12 and 13. UCDs occupy the transition from main-sequence stars to brown dwarfs (late-M and later) and are essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the lowest mass objects in the Universe. Historically, photometric monitoring of UCDs for transiting planets and rotational spot modulation has been hampered by their intrinsic faintness and the expected short duration of transit events. The K2 spacecraft provides an excellent opportunity to study these objects in more detail, thanks to the large aperture and near-continuous 80-day photometric coverage of each K2 field. 

Searching for Transiting Planets Orbiting UCDs: The discovery of a transiting-planet orbiting a UCD would having significant implications for the field of exoplanets. UCDs are small, all roughly the diameter of Jupiter, which implies deep fractional transit signatures. UCDs are also relatively bright in the infrared. A planet that transits a UCD, whether gaseous or rocky, would be an ideal target for near-infrared transit transmission spectroscopy, as has been successfully performed on super Earths orbiting mid-M dwarf stars with the Hubble Space Telescope. Future transit transmission observations with NASAs James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets, but only for those planets that transit ultra-cool dwarfs. The transits from rocky planets orbiting mid-M dwarf stars and earlier are simply not deep enough to search for biosignatures over the expected lifetime of JWST. Recent studies of short-period planet occurrence around early and mid M dwarfs show that lower mass stars have significantly more rocky short-period planets than Sun-like stars. Extrapolating to ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect a large fraction, if not all UCDs to harbor rocky planets with transit probabilities of ~10%. 

Spot morphology at the M/L transition: Studies indicate that over 90% of UCDs show evidence of surface activity in the form of H± emission; however, the nature of the activity is not fully understood. Unlike sun-like stars, UCDs have fully convective interiors and are expected to have magnetic field morphologies markedly different from the Sun. With precise photometric monitoring of UCDs with K2 we will measure the morphology of spots on the surfaces of UCDs via light curve inversion. We will also search for flare events and correlate those flare events to specific spots structures. 

Surface activity in UCDs is related to stellar wind and ultraviolet emission from their chromospheres, both of which affect the photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets. Understanding the nature of surface activity on UCDs is therefore critical for interpreting transit-transmission spectroscopy, as well as inferring the habitability of any detected planets. K2 provides a unique opportunity to study ultra-cool dwarfs in a way never before realized."

A major result from surveys for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars.  This trend is not seen, however, around super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al 2014).  We propose to search a large sample of sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] < 0.0) stars in the fields of K2 GO Cycle 4 Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 for transiting planets of all sizes.  Stars in this metallicity range fall into three populations: a) the thin-disk (which also extends into super-solar metallicity), b) the thick-disk, and c) the halo (which extends to extremely metal poor stars). These three populations differ both kinematically and chemically.  Thick disk stars exhibit a larger vertical scale height in the galactic orbits, and they also show alpha-capture element abundances enhanced by about a factor of two over thin-disk stars.  Halo stars show even more extreme kinematics and also exhibit significant enhancement of alpha-capture elements.  The discovery of the Kepler-444 system (Campante et al 2015), which comprises five sub-Earth size planets orbiting an ancient (11.2 Gy age) thick-disk star with significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe=H]=-0.69 +/- 0.09 dex) shows that planet formation started very early in the history of the galaxy.  We will compute planet occurrence rates for stars as a function of stellar metallicity, stellar population and of planet radius.  For stellar metallicity, we will consider not just the standard [Fe/H] abundance, but also the abundance of the very important alpha-capture elements.  The goal of our program is to determine the characteristics of the first stars in our Galaxy to form potentially habitable planetary systems.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W.  Cochran), the European KEST consortium (represented in this proposal by Dr. M. Fridlund),  and at KASI (led by Dr.  B.-C. Lee) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.  and will perform Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.

Targets:
We will propose a large sample of approximately 3000 targets.  They range in V magnitude from about 5 to 13, with most of the targets in the range 10 < V < 12.  Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2015, MNRAS, 247, 2880) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 80 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems. These results will provide important new constraints on the physics and chemistry of planetary system formation, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."

This is a continuation of Program GO7057 that was accepted for K2 campaigns 6 & 7 (8 targets).

Looking for planetary systems around young stars with Kepler is a compelling approach to provide constraints on the migration mechanisms and their timescales (Lloyd et al. 2013, arXiv, 1309.1520). In particular, for hot Jupiters, it would allow discriminating between migration during formation within the protoplanetary disk (e.g. Alibert et al. 2004, A&A, 417, 25) and migration through tidal interactions (e.g. Rasio & Ford 1996, Science, 274, 954) that occur on much longer timescales (>500 Myr). For our targets, K2 will provide unprecedented access to the innermost orbital regions around these stars, allowing the identification of small planet candidates within 0.3 AU. The direct imaging follow-up at high-contrast and high-angular resolution with VLT/SPHERE will not only decrease the probability of astrophysical false-positives by background objects to extremely low levels, but it will also complete the picture of these systems in the 5-50 AU range thanks to its unique sensitivity to young giant planets. In addition, some of our targets are also part of a long-term, high-precision radial velocity monitoring with HARPS at the ESO 3.6 m telescope in La Silla, which will allow bridging the gap between the K2 and SPHERE observations.

Any joint detection of a planetary system with K2 and SPHERE would be a major discovery and consti- tute a ""Rosetta stone"" system for the study and understanding of migration processes and interactions in planetary systems. This is a central question for systems with giant planets at wide orbital separation, for which the far out location could be the result of migration through gravitational interactions with other planets in the system.

In addition, photometric monitoring is of particular interest for our young targets to determine the rotational period and deduce a gyro-chronological age. The age is an essential parameter for directly-imaged companions, and any additional constraints for the age determination will be an important addition for the SPHERE observations.

In summary, we want to look for young planetary systems using two powerful exoplanet-hunting instruments, K2 and VLT/SPHERE. We propose to observe 6 stars with ages <600 Myr that will fall into the K2 Fields #11 and #13. All but one have late spectral types and a Kepler magnitude Kp<11."
GO11026,11,Elme,,Breedt,University of Warwick,E.Breedt@warwick.ac.uk,,Accretion disc variability in Cataclysmic Variables,"Accretion discs are a common occurrence in the universe. They exist on physical scales spanning orders of magnitude, ranging from the parsec scale discs which power active galactic nuclei to protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (few thousand km). The flow of material and angular momentum through these discs are governed by the same underlying physical processes, but timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion discs around cataclysmic variables (CVs) are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure and the effects of accretion rate variations, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Continuing our programme from campaigns 0 to 10, we propose to monitor the CVs and X-ray binaries in the K2 fields with the aim of building a library of high quality light curves that can be used to investigate disc-based phenomena. CVs and other accreting compact objects display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days). The unique capability of Kepler/K2 to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is key to understand accretion and accretion variability over such a wide range of timescales."

The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars need to be rotating slower than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 210 days. 

The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that many, but by no means all, Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars. 

Currently there are only three A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-57b). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars. 

Using Kepler and K2, we have a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to: 
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binarity within the Am stars, 
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars. 

Only 15 Am stars were observed during the Kepler mission, with a further 83 observed during earlier K2 Campaigns. For this proposal we have 52 targets for Campaigns 11 to 13. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to 150. 

The proposal team are experienced in the reduction of Kepler data using PyKE tools and in the analysis of time-varying photometry. We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary. 

The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."
GO11029,11,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,bod21@cam.ac.uk,,Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types cooler than M5, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such an exoplanet has not been discovered yet. As of today, K2 is the only facility that provides the required stability and photometric precision to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0 through 10 observations.

SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.

High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).

RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.

METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 11, 12 and 13, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series. The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on existing K2 data and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program.

EXPECTED YIELD. Our target list encompasses 84 M6-L6 targets. We statistically expect to detect 1 to 2 planets in this specific sample.

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes and photometry, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? In order to answer this question, we need to understand their multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates.  

The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above. Because of the limited precision on the ground based observations to measure rotation periods, we propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates. In K2 fields 11, 12 and 13, we will observe ten nearby systems, including three K and seven M dwarfs. One of the systems, GJ0176, has a known planet and the other, GJ1286, is the closest star among all three campaigns. We expect to have the most complete characterization of a set of the nearest K and M stars in all K2 fields that have ever been accomplished."
GO11035,11,Tabetha,Suzanne,Boyajian,Yale University,tabetha.boyajian@yale.edu,"Silva Aguirre, Victor; Huber, Daniel; Creevey, Orlagh; White, Timothy R",Testing asteroseismology with bright red giants using C11-13 K2 timeseries and inferometry,"We propose to observe bright red giants stars in long cadence mode in the K2 fields 11-13, where interferometric and high-resolution spectroscopic supporting observations will allow us to address several exciting science questions pertaining to 1) asteroseismic scaling relations, 2) chemical mixing processes in stellar interiors, and 3) the abundance of helium. 
Widely used in the asteroseismology of red giants, asteroseismic scaling relations connect stellar properties such as masses and radii to easy-to-derive seismic parameters such as the frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation. Although scaling relations do have some theoretical justification, they are still mostly based on the only star whose parameters we truly know: the Sun. The precise seismic K2 observations coupled with high-quality ground-based interferometric and spectroscopic data of bright nearby giants will allow us to subject the scaling relations to the most demanding tests. 
The second application is to constrain the poorly understood mixing processes working inside red giants, such as thermohaline mixing, rotation, and deep circulation. These processes are predicted to have different impact at different stages of red giant evolution, and to leave imprints in the surface chemical composition of a star. Precise seismic log (g) from K2 time series, coupled with high resolution spectroscopy, will allow for a detailed abundance determination of a large number of chemical species.  The correlations between elements (e.g. [C/ Fe] vs [N/ Fe]) and departure from their theoretically predicted values (as in the case of Li or 12 C/13 C) are tracers of internal mixing processes, and will be studied as a function of the seismically determined mass.
The third goal of this proposal is to address one of the biggest uncertainties in stellar astrophysics: the abundance of helium in stars. The helium second ionization zone inside a star produces an abrupt change in the local sound speed, which is detectable in the Fourier spectrum of time series as a periodic variation. We will construct detailed models of red giants where this variation is detected, and coupled with independent constraints on angular diameter and detailed surface composition, we will put stringent constraints on the helium abundance of red giants and test our assumptions on enrichment laws of the Galaxy.
We have selected ~30 bright (Kp<8) red giants which are ideally suited for this project due to their precisely determined distances, large angular sizes for interferometry, and detectable oscillations in the 80 day K2 baseline. Red giants observed by Kepler were generally too faint to meet these criteria, making K2 uniquely suited to perform these observations. Our proposal addresses compelling questions in stellar structure and evolution, and is hence directly related to the K2 GO solicitation."

For these binary stars, we find a striking deficiency of small planets. We propose to observe more known binary stars to confirm the deficiency. We consider only S-type circumstellar planet system, in which a planet orbits one of the binary stars, NOT circumbinary planets (P-type).

Our sample consists of 1208 binary stars, which represents the largest sample of binary stars for planet search. This sample will allow us to study small and large planets in binary stars. The former can be uniquely probed by the K2 mission. We will reduce the measurement uncertainty by a factor of 2-3, which will place better constraints on the occurrence rate of planets in binary stars

Targeting binary stars with no prior information of planet helps to unambiguously address the planet occurrence rate in binary stars. Increasing the sample size helps not only to confirm the deficiency of planets in binary stars but also study the influence of stellar companions on planets with different sizes and orbital separations. Future NASA mission in search of habitable worlds will inevitably encounter with this question: to select binary stars or not, which account for 33% of stars in the solar neighborhood. This proposal will pave the way to solve this question."
GO11038,11,William,D.,Cochran,The University of Texas at Austin,wdc@astro.as.utexas.edu,"Shporer, Avi; Johnson, Marshall C",Probing the Planetary Population of High-Mass Stars (K2-GO4),"Objectives: To date most planet searches have been confined to stars of spectral type F and later, as hotter stars have fewer spectral lines and tend to be rapidly rotating, making precise radial velocity (RV) observations difficult. By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiant stars in this mass range [1], but the masses of these subgiants have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus ~60 planet candidates that are awaiting validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement subgiant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets, and close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the subgiants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars. There are currently only ~10 such confirmed planets; this population is currently almost totally unexplored. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2.

Targets: We plan to request approximately 400 long cadence targets, ~3/4 of which will be in Field 11. The sample will consist of A and early F-type dwarfs with 8<V<12.5, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: Our colleagues at the DLR and University of Cologne (Germany) will prepare lightcurves and search for transit signals. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory and the forthcoming NRES spectrographs on the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT); we will leverage our group's experience with similar observations of Kepler prime mission targets. For long-period targets where the K2 observations are insufficient to constrain the transit emphemeris, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with LCOGT. Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other techniques. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (which uses the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect on rapidly rotating stars, where the spectral line distortion during transit is spectroscopically resolved) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit. This will continue our program to validate Kepler prime mission candidates using Doppler tomography [5]; we will use the same methodology for K2 candidates.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

GO11039,11,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",Monitoring of Targets Within 100 Parsecs,"Science Goals and Objectives: Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 parsecs provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres. A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets. It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come. I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 pc.  A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons. This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes. This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques.  Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars.  While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges. A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be 200-300 stars (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars). In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored. The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets.

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability. An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003). One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium. This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint. Long cadence observations would be appropriate.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found. These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."

E.; Raddi, Roberto; Bell, Keaton","K2 Observations of Variable White Dwarfs in Fields 11, 12 and 13","We propose observations of variable white dwarfs (WDs) in Fields 11-13 of the K2 mission. We propose short-cadence observations of known and high-probability pulsating WDs. We additionally propose short-cadence observations of known magnetic and metal-polluted white dwarfs to constrain magnetic activity in these stars, and to search for possible transits in around stars with known evolved planetary systems.

As they cool, WDs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres pulsate as DAVs (a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) when they reach the appropriate effective temperature to foster a hydrogen partial-ionization zone, which efficiently drives global oscillations. This range of temperatures empirically spans roughly 12,600-11,100 K for typical-mass (0.6 Msun) WDs. Pulsating WDs provide an important glimpse into the interior of the future of the vast majority (> 97%) of all stars in our Galaxy, including our Sun, allowing us to probe the masses and compositions of their electron-degenerate cores, as well as of their non-degenerate envelopes; to determine their internal rotation profiles; and to detect weak magnetic fields.

Since the DAV instability strip is defined by temperature, color selection is an excellent predictor of variability. Our team discovered all DAVs in the original Kepler mission, which is leading to exquisite insight into white dwarf interiors. We have applied the same photometric selection methods to K2 Fields 11-13 using the SDSS, VST/ATLAS, and VPHAS+ multiwavelength surveys, and have identified 75 excellent candidate white dwarfs on silicon in the three fields with colors consistent with the empirical DAV and DBV instability strips. Additionally, there are three previously published pulsating white dwarfs in Field 12. We have used ground-based resources to refine the atmospheric parameters of many of these candidates, confirming than a large number fall within the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. Additionally, we have confirmed pulsations in two new white dwarfs using ground-based high-speed photometry. With typical pulsations ranging from 100-1400 s, we require short-cadence observations of these white dwarfs.

Every new DAV we can observe with K2 adds significant legacy value, since it brings us that much closer to statistically significant studies of white dwarfs with ensemble asteroseismology. There were only six pulsating white dwarfs in the original Kepler mission, but that number has grown to at least 20 with K2, and will continue to grow as the extended mission progresses.

Additionally, we propose long-cadence observations of all other WD candidates in these fields, to continue our in-depth study into rotation, magnetic activity, planetary systems, and binarity in the endpoints of stellar evolution. These observations simultaneously allow for serendipitous discoveries, including possible eclipses or transits, as demonstrated by the unique disintegrating planetesimal orbiting a WD in K2 Campaign 1 (Vanderburg et al. 2015, Nature, 526, 546)."

timescale of hours and weather evolution of the clouds on timescales from days to months. Magnetic activity changes dramatically
at the stellar/substellar hydrogen-burning limits, but some ultracool dwarfs are known to flare. We will measure the white light
flare rate in well-defined statistical samples as a function of effective temperature, rotation rate, and age. Flares are tied to magnetic reconnection rates and the energy budget. We also aim to detect transiting exoplanets by continuing to monitor each available

GO11043,11,Marina,,Orio,University of Wisconsin,orio@astro.wisc.edu,,Novae in the Kepler field,"17 quiescent classical or recurrent novae will be ``on silicon'' during Kepler campaign 11. These novae have previously been observed at quiescence and are known to be at visual magnitude (and Kepler magnitude) between 15 and 21.5. Only two of these objects, among the brightest in quiescence,  have known orbital periods, so my first goal is to complete the sample or binary periods. 
   The Kepler data will give a unique opportunity to study these white dwarfs interacting binaries in detail. Because the eruptions have been well observed, and many physical parameters of the outbursts are known, measuring the orbital  periods will allow to improve and fine-tune the theory of hydrogen burning white dwarfs, the same phenomenon that may lead also to type Ia supernovae events. I will be able to correlate the binary periods with the other physical parameters that demonstrate the secular evolution of accretion and hydrogen burning. Moreover, recently I have also already been investigating a very interesting subset of novae that have highly magnetized white dwarfs, the intermediate polars, and found that the beat period of the orbital and rotational period (usually close to the rotational period of the white dwarf) is detectable in the optical light curves, albeit often with low amplitude.
    I ask to observe the tree most luminous and better known targets  with the 1 minute cadence, and the others with the long cadence (aimed mainly at the orbital period measurements). The short cadence will  allow not only measurements related to white dwarf rotation, but also of stochastic variability. Flickering reveals a direct connection with the mass transfer rate, as it has already been inferred for a few cataclysmic variables in previously obtained Kepler data. My third aim is  thus to obtain multi-component power density spectra for the three short-cadence objects. The amplitude of the broad-band flickering is correlated with the flux, which is in turn dependent on the mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf, a fundamental physical parameter in the evolution of the interacting binary.
  This investigation has been started with a classical nova and two other white dwarf binaries in campaign 7, two of them observed with short cadence.    The goals of the investigation are fully consistent with the 2014 NASA strategic plan of discovering how the universe works, and exploring how it evolves, by studying the origin and evolution of binary stars, including some of those that end as  supernovae Ia, which are of cosmological importance."

So far, stars brighter than Kp < 6 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 long-cadence observations of the brightest K2 stars in campaigns 11-13 (including 36 Oph, the brightest K dwarf observable by K2) using a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels. Asteroseismic studies of these targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants and insights into poorly understood internal processes of intermediate-mass stars such as convective core overshooting.

We selected 54 targets with Kp < 6.0 mag from the Hipparcos catalog. We will use small (~20x20 pixel) circular apertures around the saturated core for each target, and perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method (so-called halo photometry) has been demonstrated to detect pulsations for all bright Pleiades and Hyades stars observed in Campaign 4. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Our project furthermore supports galactic astrophysics, another key science area identified in the NRA, through the calibration of scaling relations for galactic archeology studies.

An initial analysis of LLRGB stars observed for our C4-C5 program has already yielded the discovery of the first potentially re-inflated warm Jupiter around an oscillating evolved star, and we propose to continue our survey by observing ~5400 targets in C11-C13 to build up a statistically significant planet sample. 

We have selected targets using spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, RAVE and LAMOST, as well as colors and reduced proper motions. Planet candidates will be detected with K2 long-cadence data using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since LLRGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planets.

The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets.

Methodology:
We will employ our extensive background in the analysis of Kepler data in order to search and provide a catalog of planet candidates from the K2 data within the ecliptic using tools and techniques developed for Kepler.  The primary goal is to generate a catalog of planet candidates for prioritization of SETI searches.  Secondary goals are to provide a well vetted sample of planet candidates to the community to follow up for asteroseismic or spectroscopic stellar characterization and radial velocity confirmation.   Future follow up with SETI resources of KEES planet candidates will provide the first constraints on the fraction of stars hosting at least one inner planet, that can discover Earth transit, and that contain intelligent life detectable to the SETI detection limits.

Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system, colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk, & studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength limiting models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies. 

Lightcurves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations and their origins. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. These 2 populations are in resonances with Jupiter & collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations. Results from the WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojans & ~40% of Hildas are either extremely elongated objects or binaries. Kepler optical light curves are required to confirm these controversial findings. Ground based surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability study due to large amounts of observing time required & nightly aliasing effects on lightcurves. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform and the correspondence between the C11 field and the L4 Trojan cloud. 


Methodology: We have identified 100 objects for study in the Hilda and Trojan asteroids to be studied with Kepler in C11-13 with magnitudes of m_V < 20. Due to the overlap between the Campaign 11 field and the L4 Trojan cloud, our request for data represents 70 objects Campaign 11, 23 objects in Campaign 12 & 7 objects in Campaign 13. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 24 days. Due to the motion of these targets, the Kepler Science Center assesses solar system program as containing more targets than proposed number of objects, (In C8, 6 Hilda targets are assessed as 4847 targets by the Kepler Science Center), thus THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity.

Relevance to K2:
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 11-13  to determine if these objects originated in the Kuiper Belt and later migrated and are amenable to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission and defined observing fields."
GO11052,11,Billy,L,Quarles,SETI Institute,billylquarles@gmail.com,"Rowe, Jason Frank; Antoci, Victoria",The heat is on: exoplanets that orbit hot stars,"Science Goals Objectives: The Kepler Mission has discovered a few thousand planet candidates, which has allowed for a statistical determination of planet size and orbital characterization.   In particular, multi-planet systems, where more than one planet is seen transiting a star have provided a wealth of information covering statistical confirmations, eccentricity distributions, mutual inclinations and dynamical stability.  We have learned that not only are planets plentiful, but are found in relatively flat and circular orbits.  However, this knowledge of the architecture exoplanetary systems is only currently valid for cooler G, K and M-dwarf stars, which were the prime targets from the original Kepler Mission.  From the Kepler Q1-Q17 catalogue there are only 254 planet-candidate systems where the host star has an effective temperature greater than 6500 K.  In stars with temperatures hotter than ~6500 K the stellar envelope structure and evolution on the main sequence is dominated by radiative transfer, opposed to cooler stars where convection plays an important role.   Misalignments between the planets orbital plane and stellar spin axis have been predominately found for stars with radiative atmospheres, whereas stars with convective envelopes typically show close alignment.  This observation is likely linked to the coupling of convective atmospheres and tidal forces.  As such, we wish to continue making observations with K2 to determine the occurrence rate and orbital properties of multi-planet systems around hot stars.

Methodology: The Kepler Mission was a planet finding machine!  Our team has extensive knowledge and experience with Kepler photometric data for both transit finding and analysis as well as performing asteroseismic analysis of stars with temperatures greater than 6500 K.  We have 236 targets selected for observation in C8 and will investigate a much larger list of target stars over C11, C12, and C13.  One of the problems of searching for planets around hotter stars is that many are known to pulsate (e.g. dSct and gDor type).  Fortunately, the pulsations can be identified and accounted for from photometric light curves to allow searches for planets to reach low-noise levels.  Our plan is to use detrended photometric data and apply asteroseismic tools to remove stellar phenomena that may affect the data and to then search for transiting planets.  We will then study the properties of the planet-candidates using transit-depths, transit-durations and impact parameter to estimate the distributions of orbital properties.  We will also estimate our planet search completeness and compare our measured properties to the properties of planetary systems found around cooler stars.

Relevance to Kepler-GO Program: Using space-based astronomical observations of star fields with K2, we will search for and characterize new planets around hot stars. Our research has the potential to determine whether the properties of the host star, convective or radiative atmospheres, play a role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.  Our proposed investigation is part of a multiple observing campaign search for which we have 236 stars selected for observation in a previous proposal.  Through our continued search of stars on the ecliptic, we will collect observations to make sure we find ample planetary systems around hot-stars to meet our research goals."

Thanks to its fast photometric cadence, continuous monitoring and high photometric accuracy, Kepler has provided unprecedented insights into various types of compact binaries, and holds an enormous potential for other astrophysical domains on top of planet hunting. Some of the most notable studies have revealed i) the mass ratio and precise orbital parameters through Doppler beaming and Romer delays for compact binaries (Bloemen et al. 2011, MNRAS,410, 178, Bloemen et al. 2012, MNRAS, 422, 2600), ii) the discovery of the rms-flux relation in the aperiodic flickering of accreting white dwarfs (WD, Scaringi et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 2854) iii) stringent tests to the disk instability model through the precise characterization of dwarf nova (DN) outburst cycles and (Cannizzo et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 117) iv) the discovery of a universal scaling relation linking the timing properties of Active Galactic Nuclei, accreting stellar-mass black holes, accreting white dwarfs and young-stellar objects (Scaringi et al. 2015, Sci. Adv, e1500686).

Here we propose to continue exploiting the capabilities of Kepler/K2, and specifically ask to observe 13 targets (6 SC and 7 LC) in Campaign 11, 3 (1 SC and 2 LC) in Campaign 12 and 2 (1 SC and 1 LC) in Campaign 13. Most targets have been selected from the Ritter & Kolb catalogue (A&A, 404, 301). Campaign 11 is particularly interesting given its close proximity to the Galactic centre, providing the opportunity to observe various X-ray binaries, including accreting stellar-mass black holes for the first time with Kepler. Because of this, additional targets are included in our target list as known X-ray binaries in Campaign 11. The precise target list will be defined on submission of the Step 2 proposal.

For all targets in our sample we will probe their broad-band variability properties. Together with similar targets observed during the previous K2 campaigns, this will form the most comprehensive study of optical aperiodic variability in accreting compact objects. Additionally for some systems we will also study the periodic emission (see e.g. Sco X-1 from Campaign 2, Scaringi et al. 2015, MNRAS, 451, 3857). With K2 we will be able to precisely fold the optical lightcurves on the orbital period of the systems. This in turn will allow us to isolate and study the different emission components arising form the secondary star, accretion disk and boundary layer/corona of the accreting objects themselves as a function of orbital phase."

evolution models with binary stars","The mass discrepancy problem in binary stars stands for the difference between the stellar component masses inferred from binary dynamics and those obtained from spectral characteristics of stars and evolutionary models. The problem clearly points to some missing physical ingredients in stellar structure and evolution theory, and is often solved by introducing an additional near core mixing into evolutionary models by means of an unusually large core overshoot. Our goal is an independent seismic evaluation of the core overshoot parameter for pulsating binary components.
Binary stars provide a valuable test of the tidal evolution theory. This theory, in particular, describes the evolution of eccentric binary orbits into the stage of two stars with synchronized spin rates and residing in a circular orbit. Current theory predicts time-scale of spins synchronization to be shorter than the time-scale of the orbit circularization. This often contradicts our observations, thus our goal is to test and, if necessary, refine tidal evolution theory, by considering different types of interactions within a binary system.
The resonant excitation of stars free oscillation modes through dynamical tides within a binary system is a direct result of the above mentioned interactions. These tidally induced oscillations provide a potential of probing deep stellar interiors, but the topic is not well explored observationally. We shall remedy the lack of high-quality photometric data for massive binary stars and detections of their tidally-induced oscillations.
A statistically significant sample of pulsating binaries with precise masses is required to meet our science goals. The current sample consists of about a hundred of binaries and is greatly biased towards short orbital periods (< 10 d). With K2, we aim at observing about 100 members of the class of massive binary stars, which will lead to significant extension of the sample, in particular towards longer orbital periods.
Our team has all necessary tools and expertise to perform photometric and spectroscopic data reduction and analyses. The pixel data files delivered by the K2 mission will be used to extract the light curves by means of the software available at the host institute of the project PI. We will rely on the data analysis strategy that proved to be very efficient (e.g., Tkachenko et al. 2014, MNRAS, 438, 3093) and comprises of using the methods like Wilson-Devinney and spectral disentangling for the analysis of light curves and stellar spectra, respectively.
The K2 mission is the only available instrument to deliver the required data for our science goal. The high-quality photometric data, coupled with the state-of-the-art modelling tools, will ensure accurate subtraction of the orbital signal from the light curves, and will allow accurate frequency and asteroseismic analyses. Tidally induced pulsations have periods of a few days, so long cadence is sufficient for our targets. 
The present team was a part of the MASSIVE consortium applying for the K2 observations during previous campaigns. We used the experience gained from previous campaigns to do a careful selection of the best K2 targets for our aims in the fields of Campaigns 11,12,&13. The total number of targets to be proposed for the observations is estimated to be about 15."
GO11059,11,Joshua,,Pepper,Lehigh University,joshua.pepper@lehigh.edu,"Labadie-Bartz, Jonathan Michael",Variability of Be Stars,"We propose to observe seven Be-type stars in K2 Campaigns 11 and 13. Be stars are rapidly rotating, with spectral type B and luminosity class V-III that exhibit line emission, which is attributed to a gaseous circumstellar disk in Keplerian motion. The physical mechanism behind the disk creation is still unclear, but the very rapid stellar rotation combined with non-radial pulsations is theorized to play an important role via mass outbursts which transfer material from the star to the disk. These outbursts appear in photometry, typically as a sudden brightening of the system followed by a more gradual return to the pre-outburst brightness level. Transient pulsational modes are sometimes associated with outbursts, showing different frequencies and amplitudes before, during, and after the outburst event (Huat et al. 2009, with CoRoT).

For 3 of the stars proposed here, we have existing light curves with baselines of many years from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT; Pepper et al. 2007) - a ground based photometric survey designed to find transiting exoplanets. Notably, HD 32190 is a classical Be star with a 9-year KELT light curve that shows very strong outburst features (up to 0.5 mag) on timescales of ~1 year, with smaller scale outbursts superimposed. Simultaneous spectroscopic observations from the Be Star Spectral Database (BeSS; Neiner et al. 2011) show significant line profile variability that is correlated in time with these photometric outbursts. K2 provides a photometric precision and uninterrupted observing window that is unavailable with ground-based observing strategies, and will allow us to study pulsations and low-amplitude outbursts that are unseen in the KELT data. The additional context given by the KELT photometric data and the BeSS spectra make HD 32190 a valuable target for an in-depth analysis, regardless of the outburst stage during the K2 observations. Another star, HD 30123, has 7 years of KELT data, but does not exhibit any clear variability or outbursts that are resolved the KELT light curve. The existing spectra for this object are simultaneous with KELT photometry and show a strong single-peaked emission line profile that grows over the course of three years, so it is likely that there are in fact outbursts injecting material into the disk with amplitudes and/or durations too small to be detectable with KELT data. K2 photometry would likely reveal these outbursts (and possibly pulsations), providing evidence that even Be stars that appear to be photometrically stable from the ground can exhibit variability in the form of pulsations and outbursts.

Our proposed observations are highly complementary to those of the Campaign 9, thanks to the different locations of Earth and Kepler that probe distinct parts of the event parameter space. Additionally, some of the selected events can be also observed by the Spitzer satellite, which will greatly alleviate the difficulties in the light curve interpretation thanks to the parallax measurements from the three locations. There will not be another chance to observe the same events from the ground and two satellites on different orbits for the foreseeable future. Hence, every event with three datasets will have very high scientific value. Each observatory (Kepler, Earth, Spitzer) will see a different lens-source configuration resulting in both greater planet sensitivity and allowing cross-checks of the results. Data from multiple observing locations in Solar System will also enable for the removal of degeneracies seen in interpretation of binary-lens events that compromise about 10% of the observed events. The events that ultimately yield parallax measurements will enlarge the sample of microlensing events with known lens distances, thus enabling an estimate of the Galactic distribution of planets, i.e., the planet occurrence rate in the disk relative to that in the bulge.

To select our targets, we will inspect all the ongoing events that are alerted by the ground-based microlensing surveys and select the ones that give the highest chance of allowing parallax measurements. Due to unpredictability of the event location as well as the uncertain nature of other event properties, Kepler GO Office has allowed us to only provide the expected number of events in Step 2 proposal and extend the submission of the targets for this proposal on a later date (July 15). The time lag between the event selection date and the start of the Campaign 11 will undoubtedly cause some of the targeted events to peak before the K2 observations begin. For these events we will constrain the parallaxes using only the falling part of the light curve as seen by K2, similarly to the events previously observed by Spitzer. The ground-based surveys will be observing the bulge till the end of 2016 season and will return to the targeted events in January 2017 to collect the photometry of the longest events, which will still be significantly magnified."

These observations are key to understanding the evolution of the RCB stars because their masses cannot be accurately estimated by other means. The ~75 days of near continuous, high-precision observations are ideal for our planned analysis of the brightness variations of the RCB stars. Recently, V1157 Sgr was the first RCB star to be observed by Kepler during the Field 7 program. The proposed observations will be at least two orders of magnitude more precise than the best that can be done from the ground, where a typical cadence is once per night and uncertainties are > 0.01 mag. These observations will provide a better understanding of the pulsation mechanisms and modes in RCB stars. RCB stars are thought to be ~0.8-0.9 M(Sun) from previous stellar pulsation modeling. These estimated masses agree well with the predicted masses of the merger products of a CO- and a He-WD. Final-flash stars, since they are single white dwarfs, should typically have masses of 0.55-0.6 M(Sun). No cool RCB star, with T(eff) = 5000-7000 K, is known to be a binary so these mass estimates are of great importance to understanding the evolution of these enigmatic stars.

RCB stars show periodic or semi-periodic light and radial velocity fluctuations due to both radial and non-radial pulsations. These stars show pulsation periods in the 40-100 d range. These variations are separate from the large declines in brightness caused by dust forming around the star. The pulsations in RCB stars are thought to arise through strange-mode instabilities. Strange modes occur in stars with high luminosity where radiation pressure dominates. RCB stars comprise a peculiar and rare class of stars that offers an excellent opportunity to reveal crucial insights into the advanced stages of stellar evolution. The first star of this class, R Coronae Borealis (R CrB), was discovered to be variable over two centuries ago. Today, the known population of RCB stars is now ~100 stars in the Galaxy. RCB stars form a class of cool, carbon-rich supergiants that have almost no hydrogen. They undergo extreme, irregular declines in brightness, of up to 8  magnitudes, due to the formation of thick clouds of carbon dust. Two scenarios have been proposed for the origin of an RCB star: the Double Degenerate and the final helium-shell flash models. The former involves the merger of a CO- and a He-WD. In the latter, a star evolving from a planetary nebula central star expands to supergiant size.

V1157 Sgr, observed in Field 7, is the first RCB star ever observed by Kepler. The data will be available at the end of March 2016. We have proposed to observe 8 additional RCB stars in Field 9. Field 11 provides an opportunity to observe 8 additional RCB stars with K2. These new proposed observations will bring our sample of RCB stars with K2 data to 17. We wish to have accurate pulsation periods for as many RCB stars as possible to see if there is a systematic change in the pulsation properties (amplitudes, periods, and multi-periodicities) as a function of effective temperature. We would like to understand how the pulsation/convection coupling affects pulsations in cool stars, and to see the effects of Fe opacity in the hotter RCB stars. The duration of the K2 monitoring is useful since it will cover almost two complete pulsation cycles for an average RCB star. We plan to analyze the pulsations in the new K2 lightcurves using our codes to model the radial and non-radial strange modes. The study of the pulsations of RCB stars will be crucial in helping to distinguish between the WD merger and final flash scenarios."

Continuous monitoring of these rare but important K2 targets will provide invaluable data for detailed high precision characterization of both the planets and their host stars.

Ground-based studies of the cooler F-G spectral type objects have shown pulsation with amplitudes of a few 0.1 mags with dominant periods of 35 to 160 days and additional weaker periods of similar time scale.  Hotter (B type) objects are found to vary but on much shorter time scales (< few days), and we have not been able to observe these from the ground with a cadence that allows the periods to be determined.  Fortunately two pre-PN are available in the field for Campaign 11.  The K2 mission with the 30 min cadence provides an excellent means to accomplish this goal and for the first time determine the pulsation periods for a hot pre-PN.  These can be used to determine the structure and physical properties of the star, a task that has been accomplished in spectacular fashion with Kepler data for stars in many other phases of their evolution."

Two complementary approaches have been adopted, the first centered on in-depth studies of the Sun itself, and the second focusing on the study of solar analogs, stars which are like the Sun and thus might shed light on characteristics of its composition, structure, activity, planetary system, evolution, and future. The utility of the study of solar analogs is broad, ranging from finding night-time proxies for the Sun for calibration purposes to their use as snapshots of the evolutionary history of the Sun. Their study has helped to establish that chromospheric activity is key to understanding stellar rotation, activity, and dynamos. The project proposed here is aimed at providing a large consistent set of well-vetted solar analogs in order to address these questions. We will make use of the K2 mission fields to obtain precise photometric time series of approximately 1000 solar analogs, supplemented by asteroseismology and ground- and space-based spectroscopic data for the brighter and more promising candidates. From this data we will derive rotation periods, spot coverages, and flare rates for a well-calibrated sample of solar analogs. This work expands on the PIs ongoing Kepler and K2 analysis, and supports an ongoing project under NASA's Living With a Star program; the use of new fields will also allow us to compare different stellar populations and provide a growing sample of test data for the study of stellar activity, rotation, and dynamos.

The chosen targets will be selected on the basis of existing ground-based photometry supplemented by spectroscopy when available and guided by previous results and population models using TRILEGAL. We anticipate that <10% of the stars in our sample will be giants, but we can make use of light curves and power spectra to eliminate giants from our sample after the fact based on granulation noise (Mathur et al. 2011, Bastien et al. 2013, 2015). We will reduce our limiting magnitude from the ~14 we used for Kepler to ~12.5 to roughly compensate for the increased noise in K2 compared to Kepler, and make ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up easier. In addition,  our brightest candidates should be amenable to asteroseismology."

We propose to monitor a set of CVs in the K2 fields of Campaigns 11, 12 and 13. The Cycle 4 fields represent the extremes of stellar densities with the directions toward the pole and Galactic center.

They are crucial objects for understanding the structure and evolution of stars, and to explore connections between pulsation, mass loss, convection and rotation. Moreover, they are key tools in galactic and extragalactic studies as distance indicators. Still, only a few members of this group have been observed by space missions before K2. We are currently building up the most comprehensive sample of Cepheid light curves with the K2 mission and the upcoming field of views contain many important targets in various directions of the Galaxy. 

Space-based, continuous photometry revealed many puzzling phenomena in these stars. The lone Kepler Cepheid, V1154 Cyg exhibit small-scale irregularities (period jitter) and low-level modulation. Ground-based surveys indicate that first overtone stars are expected to have various low-amplitude additional modes. Hydrodynamical calculations suggest that various dynamical effects and even chaos can occur in the pulsation of type II Cepheids. These effects hold clues to various physical insights, but their observations require high-precision, continuous photometry that only K2 can provide. 

The three campaigns focus on very different Galactic directions:

The bulge
In Field 11 we identified ~150 targets, most of which are type II Cepheids. 124 candidates were collected from the still unpublished data of the OGLE IV survey. The high-priority targets include rare double- and triple-mode Cepheids, such as V767 Sgr, among others. 15 targets that we also included in our C9 DDT proposal fall into the overlapping region between Campaigns 9 and 11. Given the long pulsation periods of Cepheids, extended observations are highly desired. In addition, two Cepheids are members of globular clusters M9 and NGC 6316.  

The halo
The direction of Field 12 is not favorable for these stars, but we found 6 targets, of which 3 appear to be anomalous Cepheids. Many aspects of these stars are not well understood, including their formation. 

The outer Milky Way
In Field 13, towards the anti-center we found 10 targets. The priority target in this campaign is the well-known Cepheid SZ Tau that was already observed by MOST and it is accessible for the BRITE space telescopes as well. The star pulsates in the first overtone, so additional modes and/or dynamical effects are expected. The short MOST data already suggested the presence of some cycle-to-cycle variations. The observations would provide direct comparison of the capabilities of various space missions and form a multi-year data set for this star. 
 
Technical details
The KASC Working Group 7 has been involved in the Kepler mission from the start and has all the necessary skills to reduce the target pixel files and analyze the data, including the handling of crowded fields. We propose all stars to be observed in long cadence mode. Two stars, BF Oph and SZ Tau are very bright (6.9 and 6.4 mag, respectively) and can likely be recovered from the smear data. However, we request to assign a dedicated pixel mask to SZ Tau, given the importance and unique possibilities this star offers for us. We also note that BF Oph and SZ Tau are bright enough to be included in the Tycho-Gaia Asterometric Solution, expected to be released in 2016."

We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2, conducting reconnaissance spectroscopy, and ultimately gathering high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models. 

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small. 

We propose a ranked list of 13,356 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We generated this list by first searching for all moderately bright stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 11, 12, and 13, and then using the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. We also propose one short-cadence target: HIP116454, the first exoplanet system discovered from K2, which our team published last year.

We will identify planet candidates using the planet detection pipeline developed by our team members. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities. 

The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 80 nights per year of guaranteed time per year. The follow-up of small planets from Kepler and K2 is the top scientific priority of HARPS-N. 

We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. Our team has already delivered such products for previous K2 campaigns. 

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a significant impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."
GO11072,11,Mike,D,Reed,Missouri State University,mikereed@missouristate.edu,"Jeffery, Christopher Simon; Ostensen, Roy H.; Baran, Andrzej S; Telting, John","Asteroseismology discerning the properties of hot horizontal branch stars: Fields 11, 12, and 13","We propose to explore core structure of horizontal branch stars by applying asteroseismological tools to K2 data of extreme horizontal branch (spectral class subdwarf B) stars. Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars some of which happen to pulsate, and that allows us to probe their structure. From Kepler's main 
mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes to constrain structure models from period spacings and frequency multiplets. Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age- some stars show mode trapping while in others it is almost completely absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of different evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models.Frequency multiplets also tell us rotation periods and orientation of pulsation axes. From this information we can measure rotation profiles and have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary periods down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components. From K2 Campaign 1, we discovered the first known ellipsoidal variable which rotates subsynchronously. We made significant progress from the original Kepler mission. However, each sdB pulsator we have examined so far has had unique features. This tells us that we have not  completed the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). To fully exploit K1 and K2 data, we need more pulsators to cover the complete range. It would also be a huge benefit to have more examples of pulsators in binaries, as that allows us to more fully explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection. Thus far, we have discovered one solid-body rotator and one radially-differential rotator. To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing 
that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of a selection of known and likely sdB pulsators. The SC data can fully exploit pulsations and short-period (1 day) binaries. Only K2 provides sufficient accuracy, duty cycle, and duration necessary to fully understand the pulsations. There is no planned mission that can compete with the accuracy of K2. K2 really is the only tool for this work. Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including 
spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.
We will be proposing for about five to eight stars per campaign. We only apply for the most promising targets, both in terms of pulsations and interesting binary properties. We are proposing to observe two binary pulsators, EQ Psc, discovered with K2's engineering data and V1405 Ori, a rare p-mode pulsator in a short-period binary. We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include undergraduate students as significant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training. Graduate students at European partner institutions will also be working with us; processing and interpreting pulsations as part of their thesis work."
GO11076,11,George,H,Jacoby,GMTO / Carnegie,jacoby@noao.edu,"Kronberger, Matthias; Long, Joseph D; De Marco, Orsola; Hillwig, Todd C",A Statistically Critical Sample of Planetary Nebula Central Stars to Assess Their Binary Frequency,"It was believed until recently that all stars of 1 to 8 Msun enter a short (<50,000 yr) planetary nebula (PN) phase between the AGB and white dwarf phases. This textbook picture of stellar evolution is failing. Considerable evidence now exists to argue that PN formation requires unusual circumstances (e.g., binary interactions; De Marco 2009).

The textbook model fails in several ways: (1) the number of PNe in galaxies is 5X too low, (2) PNe should not form in globular clusters but they do, (3) >80% of PNe are non-spherical yet their progenitor stars have spherical winds, and (4) the PN luminosity function (PNLF) method for measuring galaxy distances should place ellipticals 3X too far but doesn't. These anomalies can be explained if most PNe are a manifestation of binary interactions rather than a normal phase of evolution (Jacoby et al 1997; De Marco 2009). In terms of broader impact, resolving the PN formation mechanism can explain the success of the PNLF, improving confidence in its results, and change our expectations for the chemical composition of material returned to the ISM, which affects galactic chemical evolution. 

We monitored all 6 PN central stars (PNCS) in Keplers original field. Ground-based data suggested that 15% (i.e., 1) PNCS would exhibit variability of sufficient amplitude (5%) to imply a close companion (Miszalski et al. 2009). With Keplers superior photometry, we detected periodic variability in 3 PNCS and quasiperiodic behavior in a fourth, at amplitudes up to 100X lower than ground-based data can measure. All 4 variables are very likely a consequence of binary interactions (De Marco et al 2015).

Of the remaining 2 PNe, Kepler could not separate the PNCS from the nebula in one case. In the other  (Abell 61), the star didnt vary, but its spherical morphology is compatible with a single star origin having no photometric variation. Thus, all Kepler PNe are consistent with the binary hypothesis. 

We have since examined data from K2 campaigns 0 (3 PNe) and 2 (4 PNe).  These PNe have fainter stars and more compact nebulae than those in the Kepler field. Also, the K2 sensitivity is degraded relative to Kepler; 2 of the 4 variables seen in the Kepler field would have been missed with K2. Still, we did find 1 excellent contact binary with a period of 0.6d. 

We plan to develop a tuned reduction scheme that addresses our problem specifically, i.e. faint stars embedded in bright sky from the nebula. We will focus on that effort when data for campaign 7 targets (8 PNe) are released. The main issue is centroiding the PNCS in busy fields; methods exist (Lauer 1999) that can improve centroid measurement and photometry for undersampled data. 

Due to the challenging targets in the K2 fields, our useful sample remains small despite a total of 22 objects. Campaign 11, though, covers an extremely PN-rich field with 195 PNe falling on silicon. Most of these suffer similar issues: faint stars, compact nebulae, crowded fields. We will include all targets for completeness and future analysis, noting that 36 PNe have quality comparable to those in the Kepler field.
 
That will bring the Kepler binary central star search to a statistical level that is better than other binary PNCS detection methods (Miszalski et al 2009; Douchin et al 2015). We will again follow up photometric variables with radial velocity spectra from Gemini to validate binary periodicities (see De Marco et al 2015). 

This is a continuing program from Kepler cycle 3 (6 objects), and the K2 Campaigns 0, 2, and 7 (15 objects). We will drastically improve the statistics of the sample to >50 PNe. Campaign 11 is essential, as it is the most populated field to study PNe with Kepler.

GO11082,11,Michal,,Siwak,Cracov Pedagogical University,michal.siwak@gmail.com,,A photometric study of pre-main sequence stars,"We propose to continue space-based Kepler photometric monitoring of pre-main sequence stars. In our study we concentrate on Classical T Tauri-type stars (CTTS), well known from rapid and complicated variability due to vigorous accretion of disc plasma. A sample of above 200 stars is proposed for observations, mostly the members of Taurus-Auriga Star Forming Region (Campaign 11 - 50 targets, 12 - 5 targets, 13 - 151 targets). They will provide first large representative sample of stars (both known in Simbad database as YSOs, CTTSs, Herbig Ae/Be, WTTSs, PMSs and carefuly choosen objects classified as emision line stars) of different age and SFR membership to address the following issues: 
1) regime of accretion in CTTS: stable, moderately stable or unstable,
2) does the accretion regime in CTTS alternate between (moderately)stable and unstable, what is the typical timescale,
3) which Herbig Ae/Be stars show magnetically-controlled accretion like CTTS,
4) study of QPOs in CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars with wavelet technique: how fast do they change in time
5) determination of rotational periods of CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars if catched in a stable or moderately stable accretion regime, as well as of WTTS modulated by long lived cold spots (including differential rotation),
6) do other CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars show short lasting, shallow dips like TW Hya,
7) does HBC 393 show tiny (amplitude of 1-10%) QPOs, like these discovered by us with MOST for FU Ori in 2009/10 and confirmed in 2013/14 (unpublished,) which may allow for determination of an inner disc radius ?,
8) will we be lucky enough to discover planetary transit around one of the young stars?

Among the proposed targets is HL Tau and LkCa 15, famous from their stunning ALMA and high-contrast images, likely revealing effects of disc-planet interactions and forming protoplanet(s), respectively. To get comparison with photometrically best observed so far from space TW Hya, we will likely ask to observe them in a short-cadence mode. Due to obvious spacecraft limitations, the other targets must be observed in a long-cadence mode only. We propose to observe only these stars which are bright enough for Kepler and well-separated to get accurate photometric precision. The only problem is expected with HBC 393, which may be too faint for Kepler. Yet, we propose to make an attempt to observe the star as it is the only FUor available for it in the closest future.
     Approved Kepler observations of brightest targets, especially CTTS, will be supported by ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic observations to estimate variety of their physical parameters. For this purpose we plan to use Polish access on SALT, SAAO and ESO telescopes."
GO11083,11,Adam,Gabriel,Jensen,University of Nebraska-Kearney,JensenAG@unk.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson; Endl, Michael; Redfield, Seth",Searching for Extended Exoplanetary Atmospheres Around Active Stars,"A key question in studying any planetary atmosphere is what happens at the boundary between the atmosphere and interplanetary space. This unbound, outermost layer of an atmosphere is called its exosphere.  Several observations of extended atmospheres have been made (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Schlawin et al. 2010; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010, 2012; Fossati et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2012; Cauley et al. 2015; Cauley et al. 2016, in preparation) in hydrogen (both ground-state and excited) and various metals.

Our team detected excited, n=2 hydrogen (through hydrogen alpha absorption) in the exosphere of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012), the first such detection in an exoplanet atmosphere. Follow-up observations (Cauley et al. 2015; Cauley et al. 2016, in prep.) confirmed this result by detecting exospheric absorption in hydrogen alpha, hydrogen beta, and hydrogen gamma, and also observed a significant pre-transit signal in these lines.  The pre-transit signal is variable between the two observation sets and the physical interpretation is not clear.  Jensen et al. (2012) hypothesized that the excited hydrogen in the exosphere (the transit signal) may be correlated with chromospheric activity, as HD 189733b, the only planet in that paper's sample of four planets to show H-alpha absorption, was also the most chromospherically active in the sample (as measured by S_HK and log [R'_HK] indices).

In Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 3, we proposed to search for planets around stars which are candidates for chromospheric activity in the Kepler 8 and 10 fields.  We found dozens of suitable targets based on the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Survey's catalogue of chromospherically active stars (Zerjal et al. 2013).  We now propose to do the same for Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 4 for the Kepler Campaign 11, 12, and 13 fields.  Because the 11 and 12 fields are in the southern celestial hemisphere, these are largely covered by the RAVE survey in particular, whereas the RAVE survey mostly covered field 10.  Therefore, we expect to have roughly double the number of targets for this cycle as we did in the previous cycle, roughly tripling the overall sample.  This will greatly improve the chance of success of the accepted Cycle 3 proposal at minimal cost of targets to the K2 mission.

Looking for planets around active stars with radial velocity methods is often disfavored because the stellar noise limits RV precision.  However, this makes the transit method the more important way to detect planets in these cases. Furthermore, if any of these stars do have a transiting planet, they will be excellent potential candidates for follow-up spectroscopy with the large ground-based telescopes (Keck I, HobbyEberly Telescope) that our team has used in the past to detect exospheric absorption. The goal of follow-up spectroscopic observations would be to search for excited hydrogen absorption from an exosphere, including possible pre-transit signals. As a secondary science product, many of these active stars will have light curves worth studying on their own for stellar astrophysics purposes."
GO11084,11,Martin,,Asplund,Australian National University,martin@mso.anu.edu.au,"Howes, Louise M; Casagrande, Luca; NATAF, DAVID MOISE; Stello, Dennis; Dotter, Aaron",Dating the oldest stars: Asteroseismology of Milky Way bulge stars from redshifts z>10,"The Population III stars are still eluding discovery. The first stars and their immediate successors are predicted to have formed within the first 300 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to redshifts z>15. To date, there are no spectroscopically confirmed galaxies or gamma-ray bursts with z>9 (Zitrin et al. 2015). The best hope for finding any first star may therefore be to find a stellar relic lurking in our Galactic backyard. 

According to cosmological models, the very first stars formed in the centers of the largest and most over-dense dark matter mini-halos, which subsequently accreted material to become the inner regions of large galaxies (e.g. Greif et al. 2012). The oldest stars should thus typically reside today in the bulges of galaxies like the Milky Way: metal-poor bulge stars are predicted to have typical formation redshifts of z>10 (Salvadori et al. 2010). Indeed, of the bulge stars with [Fe/H]<-3, approximately 15% should have formed at z>15 (Tumlinson 2010), an otherwise completely inaccessible cosmic period. These stars thus provide a unique insight to one of the hottest topics in contemporary cosmology and astrophysics.

With the EMBLA survey using SkyMapper photometry and AAOmega/AAT spectroscopy, we have recently discovered for the first time a large number of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way bulge, as metal-poor as [Fe/H]=-4.0 (Howes et al. 2014, 2015). Most of these metal-poor bulge stars have tight orbits constrained to the central regions of the Galaxy, convincingly demonstrating that they are not simply halo star interlopers. Both their extremely metal-poor nature and kinematics imply that they are prime candidates for being the oldest known objects in the Universe. Asteroseismology with K2 now offers the unique opportunity to date some of these stars, potentially probing for the first time the z>15 Universe.

We propose to observe with K2 ~380 metal-poor [Fe/H]<-2 bulge giants located within the Campaign 11 footprint to derive asteroseismic information, especially stellar ages. We have already determined reliable spectroscopic parameters (Teff, [Fe/H]) for the targets, facilitating an asteroseismic analysis of these red giant branch stars. Our sample size is driven by the expected asteroseismic age uncertainties of ~20% from K2 data for red giants (Stello et al. 2015, ApJL, 809, L3), which implies a mean statistical age uncertainty for our sample of ~200Myr, i.e. corresponding to differentiating between redshift z=15 and 10. These K2 observations will also allow a direct comparison of average formation redshift of bulge stars and halo stars with the same [Fe/H] which have been observed in previous K2 campaigns, irrespective of possible systematic errors in age determinations for metal-poor stars; the age difference between z=10 (expected for bulge stars) and z=5 (halo) is ~700Myr."

Rotation periods, in particular, provide important clues to the physics behind the formation and evolution of stars and subsequent planetary systems. When the latter are detected, studying the relation between the orbital period of the planet(s) and the rotation period of the parent star can also shed light on the spin-orbit alignment and on the angular momentum history of the system (e.g. Bouvier et al. 2013). In addition, stellar activity due to rotation and/or pulsations affects the measured radial velocity signature of the host star, and can even mimic inferred Keplerian motion. 

Prior to NASAs Kepler mission, stellar rotation was typically deduced from spectroscopy using the rotationally-broadened absorption line profiles. This technique, however, is both expensive in terms of telescope time, and more importantly, suffers from degeneracies stemming from its dependency on the a-priori unknown stellar radius and obliquity; it is also tailored to fast rotators. The mission has truly revolutionized the field, offering, for the first time, continuous monitoring of stellar flux allowing precise measurements of the rotation periods of tens of thousands of stars (e.g. McQuillan, Mazeh & Aigrain 2014). K2 builds up on this legacy, offering new opportunities to study stellar variability in a variety of settings  stars at the bottom of the main sequence, white dwarfs, binaries, stars in open clusters, etc (e.g. Kawaler 2014, Scholz et al. 2015, Rebel et al. 2016). 

Here we propose to observe 9 exoplanet-candidate host stars (1 transiting and 8 RV planets), study their long-term stellar activity and measure their photometrically-modulated rotation periods. Our targets span a range of stellar types (from K giants to M dwarfs), of planetary periods (from 3 days to 5 years) and masses/sizes (from ~2.5 REarth to ~10MJup). The rotation periods for six targets have been inferred from spectroscopically-measured vsin i (with various degree of confidence) and model-dependent radius. These periods range from 20 to 60 days  ideally suited for robust detection and confirmed by K2. For three of the targets the rotation periods are unknown. In addition, the nature of some of these candidates suffers from degeneracy between the measured radial velocities and inferred Keplerian motions. 

Our program will a) provide direct measurements for the rotation periods; b) break degeneracies between stellar rotation and exoplanetary orbits; and c) allow for comprehensive characterization of these systems. In combination with v sin i measurements (where available), our results will also allow model-independent measurements of the stellar radii. In addition, the observations will be sensitive to transits caused by additional exoplanets, and in the case of the one transiting planet  to transit timing variations. While there are ground-based photometric measurements for some of our targets, none of the available data compares to the precision, quality and uninterrupted monitoring of K2, making the observatory uniquely-suited for the proposed investigation. Thus our program will add to the growing legacy of stellar activity research enabled by the mission, provide input for gyrochronological studies, and offer new insight into the stellar astrophysics of these planet-hosting stars. The proposed study will directly support NASAs goal to Discover and study planets around other stars, in order to understand the underlying physical processes of exoplanets and to improve understanding of their origins."

Scientific Justification
We request K2 monitoring of unidentified and known X-ray sources in Campaigns 11 through 13, compiled from a variety of sources including the Chandra Source Catalog and the Million Quasar Catalog, to probe accretion onto compact objects at a variety of mass and time scales. Our KSwAGS survey found 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., 2015). Approximately half were active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various types (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring M-stars). A Kepler GO survey (PI: Still) of Chandra point sources resulted in a similar distribution of stars to active galaxies. High precision optical follow-up is scientifically useful for all sources; the AGN allow for a study of variability characteristics as a function of SMBH mass (Smith et al., 2015) and the stars allow for the study of a variety of rapid rotators and chromospheric activity (Howell et al., 2016). We received time for K2 to monitor KSwAGS sources in Field 4, and Field 8. This proposal has identical scientific goals and will continue the K2 optical monitoring of X-ray sources, but with target selection criteria that relies on archival X-ray observations only and not on new Swift pointings.

Previous AGN in the original Kepler field were selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012). These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 10^8 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum is dominated by starlight rather than AGN light (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2012). Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be constrained by a ~80-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks. This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk). This further monitoring will critically enhance the sample numbers of K2-monitored AGN discovered using a relatively unbiased selection method. We expect on the order of 100 targets in Fields 11 and 13, and about 60 in Field 12.

Methodology and Relevance to NASA Astrophysics Science Goals
We aim to use K2s impressive photometric precision to detect characteristic variability timescales using Fourier analysis. These timescales are the only possible direct observables of AGN accretion physics, which remains an important astrophysical mystery and directly addresses NASA Astrophysics goal to ""[d]iscover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars."".  Additionally, these X-ray selected targets will fill in the phase-space of black hole mass and accretion rate, complementing our work in the original Kepler field."
GO11087,11,Keivan,Guadalupe,Stassun,Vanderbilt University,keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu,"Boyd, Patricia T.; Vega, Laura Daniela; Montez, Rodolfo",Understanding the Mysterious RV Tau Phenomenon with K2,"Long after low- to intermediate-mass stars (1-8 Msun) leave the main sequence and reside in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, they experience huge amounts of mass loss reaching rates up to 10^{-4} Msun/yr that eventually shape to spherically symmetric shells of gas and dust around the hot core further create planetary nebulae (PN). However observations show PN morphologies to be diverse and asymmetric challenging the interpretation that PN come from single star systems. Consequently requiring that the majority of PN originate from binary star systems. We propose to confirm this condition by seeking to study the evolutionary status and properties of the poorly studied RV Tauri (RV Tau) variable stars that are thought to be the missing link between post-AGB and PN. 
RV Tau variable stars have been studied for more than 75 years yet they still remain a mystery. The physics behind these stars make them exhibit unique photometric variation in their light curves of alternating deep and shallow minima. These variations are thought to be associated to the instability of the star that leads to radial pulsations. These strange stars are very luminous (~1000 Lsun) with temperatures of 4000-6000 K or spectral classes from G to K. Jura (1986) identified RV Tau stars as post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) objects due to their high luminosity, mass-loss history, and large infrared excess due to circumstellar dust. However, it is not yet understood if RV Tau stars are a peculiar or a common phase in stellar evolution. Infrared excesses in the RV Tau stars' spectral energy distributions indicate the presence of circumstellar discs that might be due to accretion from a companion star. Thus RV Tau stars might provide clues on the evolution of binary systems. De Marco (2009) suggested that the asymmetric morphology found in the majority of planetary nebulae is probably due to binarity. This suggests that the short-lived poorly-studied RV Tau phase may predict a missing intermediate link between stars in the AGB phase and a planetary nebula phase (Willson & Templeton 2009). Hence, the RV Tau phase might represent the intermediate phase of stellar evolution for binary stars and thus, progenitors of planetary nebulae.

Initial Progress with Kepler:

Our goal is to better understand these stars and determine their place in the context of stellar evolution in order to confirm if they are in fact post-AGB successors and PN progenitors. In our preliminary analysis (Vega et al. 2016, in prep.) we use DF Cyg in the the original Kepler data as a test case to investigate the origin of RV Tau stars. Kepler has obtained the highest-precision light curve of any RV Tau star to date with ~4 yr of nearly continuous data. The Kepler light curve of DF Cyg reveals the RVa periodic variations of the light curve in unprecedented detail. We plan to establish what types of physical processes can make such a signature. We measured the arrival times of the deep and shallow minima. They seem to be consistent with a ~50-d period showing a linear trend across time. We are using the minima arrival times as a ""clock"" to further explain a long-term variation exhibited by DF Cyg. The residuals of this linear trend display that the minima arrival times are progressively coming in a day or two late for ~700-d duration, then they shift back to their stable arrival time. We argue that this is due to a secondary star disrupting these minima arrival times at closest approach to the primary. 

Proposed Observations with K2 Cycle 4:

There are 159 semi-regular and post-AGB objects identified from the cross-matched EPIC-Simbad catalog in Campaigns 11-13 (the majority in Campaign 11), which could be suitable RV Tau candidates. We plan to use similar techniques as Hartig et al. (2014) for correcting the data. We also plan to use the ""cotrending"" technique to remove instrumental effects while preserving the astrophysical signals at short periods."
GO11093,11,Bettina,,Posselt,Pennsylvania State University,posselt@psu.edu,"Kargaltsev, Oleg; Pavlov, George",Monitoring the archetype of supergiant fast X-ray transients,"We propose to monitor the light curve of the archetype supergiant fast X-ray transient (SFXT) - IGR J17544-2619 - with Kepler during campaign 11. The rare SFXTs are high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) consisting of a neutron star (NS) and an OB supergiant companion. The X-ray activity of SFXTs covers a huge dynamical range of 5 orders of magnitude on time scales of a few hours. This is very unusual since normal supergiant HMXBs display a fairly constant average luminosity with typical variations of a factor of 10-50 on shorter time scales (minutes to about an hour). The SFXT phenomenon has been interpreted as accretion onto the NS from a clumpy wind from the OB donor. However, there are several open questions regarding this interpretation. The prototypical SFXT IGR J17544-2619 (J17544 in the following), for example, exhibited a giant X-ray outburst in 2014, spanning 6 orders of magnitude in luminosity, which is difficult to explain in the clumpy-wind accretion scenario. Romano et al. 2015 proposed instead the formation of a transient accretion disk around the NS. One key to understand the nature of SFXTs is multiwavelength monitoring of these objects.

J17544 is located at 3 kpc and consists of a NS orbiting a V=12.65 mag O9Ib star with an inferred orbital period of 4.926+/-0.001d (Pellizza et al. 2006; Rahoui et al. 2008, Clark et al. 2009). From daily X-ray monitoring observations we know that J17544 shows X-ray activity for about 50% of the time (Romano 2015a). Large outbursts of IGR J17544 are picked up automatically by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope about 3-4 times a year. 
Due to the outburst duration of just a few hours and the difficulty to schedule follow-up observations soon enough, there exist no contemporaneous optical data before, during or right after an X-ray outburst for any SFXT. Yet, simultaneous optical-X-ray observations during an outburst could provide useful insights into the relation between the activity of the donor O star and the accretion-powered X-ray luminosity, as well as on the accretion process itself. Observed optical magnitude changes during an outburst would be even more significant if the binary is well monitored and characterized at these wavelengths immediately before the outburst. Kepler is the ideal instrument to obtain the needed high-accuracy photometric monitoring over a long time. During the Kepler visit of about 80 days, there is a 90% chance that there will be a bright X-ray outburst from J17544 (which Swift would automatically detect and slew to the target for X-ray observations). A Kepler photometric light curve at optical wavelength will allow us to search for eclipses and potentially unusual activity of the O-star before, during, and after the X-ray outburst. The light curve during the quiescent phase is needed to characterize the activity of the O9Ib star and statistically pin down deviations in the wake of outbursts."
GO11094,11,Michael,Thomas,Carini,Western Kentucky University,mike.carini@wku.edu,,Rapid Optical Variability in Infrared and Optically Bright blazars,"Blazars are extreme examples of the phenomena known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak or completely absent discrete spectral features leaves us with only continuum variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F11, F12 and F13 field of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of blazars with Kep magnitude < 18 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip (WIBRaLS) that are not previously identified blazars. The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of tens of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density on timescales from tens of minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to lengthen the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies. This is a continuation of a program started in K2 Cycle 1. Our results so far show that the observed variability is characterized by linear trends with timescales of tens of days at the 5-20% level with shorter timescale, smaller discrete events and/or changes in slope present. A minority of sources display more complicated, violent variability behavior. A PSD analysis revealed PSD slopes in the range of -1.2 to -3.03, consistent with what is generally seen in blazar light curves."
GO11095,11,Geraldine,J,Peters,University of Southern California,gjpeters@mucen.usc.edu,"Wilson, R. E.",Gas Stream and Spot Dynamics in Early-Type Interacting Binary Systems,"We propose Long Cadence K2 photometry of 42 binaries with Algol-type light curves in Campaign Fields 11 and 13 to study gas stream impact and spot dynamics that influence the evolution of these systems. Most early-type stars begin as binary or multiple star systems, so an understanding the evolution of the Algol systems is critical for a more general knowledge of massive star and galactic evolution. The K2 mission and the modeling capabilities of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary system analysis program present a unique opportunity to probe gas stream dynamics and/or magnetic activity from the recently discovered quadrature brightness variations in Algol binaries that we call L/T variables. L/T is the flux ratio between the Leading and Trailing hemispheres on the primary star. The L/T phenomenon was discovered in Kepler data and has never been reported in ground-based photometry. L/T behavior is likely due to changes in either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the impact site's location and movement can be diagnostic of stream dynamics that may be modulated by magnetic fields. In the cool spot scenario the variability is a consequence of magnetic activity on the mass loser. In K2 Cycle 4 we are extending our study to close eclipsing systems with periods less than 1.0 day to investigate whether enhanced tidal interaction has influence on the L/T ratio and behavior. The Kepler and K2 databases are deficient in observations of very short-period Algols.  New data from Cycle 4 will improve our statistical study of the percentage of Algols that show L/T inequality and indicate whether there is a preference for L > T or the reverse.   Modeling the K2 light curves with the WD program, stellar and spot parameters, including spot motions, will be determined so as to generate a virtual image of the binary versus time. The updated WD program will be made available for future applications by others working with the Kepler/K2 databases."

This proposal follows similar ones we submitted for K2 campaigns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, for which we got awarded (GO: 0073, 1034, 3064, 4105, 5105, 6033, 7033). Even though many eclipsing binaries were observed by Kepler, almost none were done at short cadence, which prevented from detecting solar-like oscillations of systems composed of main-sequence and sub-giant stars. The main purpose of this series of proposals is to access such kind of systems. 

Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. As illustrated by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, asteroseismology is an efficient method to measure masses, radii, and ages of large numbers of stars, which is of prime importance to test stellar evolution. However, a crucial test of both asteroseismic masses and radii of a large sample of stars with independent measurements of those quantities has not yet been carried out. Eclipsing binary systems (EBs) potentially permit such an exercise by allowing for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, provided that spectral lines are detectable for both components. EBs are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough (e.g. Gaulme et al. 2014). 

So far, all published stars known to both display solar-like oscillations and belong to EBs are red-giants (RGs), and all have been detected by the Kepler mission. The first detection was the 408-day period system KIC 8410637 (Hekker et al. 2010, Frandsen et al. 2013). Since then, Gaulme et al. (2013 & 2014) reported a list 18 RG eclipsing-binary (RG/EB) candidates, of which 14 displayed oscillations. Beck et al. (2014 & 2015) reported the discovery of 18 stars with tidally excited pulsations (``heartbeat''), where each system has a RG component with oscillations, and three are also EBs. Two of these systems, KIC 8410637 and 9246715 have been completely characterized by combining photometry and radial velocities (Frandsen et al. 2013, Rawls et al. 2016). Both show a fairly good agreement between asteroseismic and photo-dynamical estimates of surface gravity and mean density, even though (Huber et al. 2014) contested the agreement regarding KIC  8410637. Provided that oscillations are detected, observing known EBs with K2 is a unique opportunity to extend the sample of systems to test asteroseismology. 

The purpose of this GO proposal is to observe a small set (maximum 6 per field) of eclipsing binaries that are already well characterized in terms of physical parameters (orbits, masses, radii). Doing so present two main advantages. Firstly, observing well-known systems helps predicting the likelihood of detecting solar-like oscillations. Secondly, the objective is to optimally focus our available resources for ground-based follow-up observations on the most rewarding targets. High-resolution spectroscopy is very time consuming, when one is aiming for precise radial velocities and high signal-to-noise data that serves as input for spectral-disentangling techniques. 

Funding will be requested to pay a graduate student for a 1-year and two trips to Europe, where most of the asteroseismic conferences/workshops are held.

The field has transformed from simple identification to comprehensive categorization and characterization of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems. Analyses of data provided by the NASA's Kepler mission has revolutionized this field by compiling a statistically significant number of transiting planets and planetary candidates, providing time series data for a large sample of systems that can be utilized in consistent comparative studies (e.g. Angerhausen et al., 2015). 

One promising new way to further characterize some of these transiting systems are methods using ground-based multi-object spectrographs for transit and eclipse spectrophotometry such as GMOS in the optical (e.g. Stevenson et al., 2014; Huitson et al., 2016, in prep.) or MOSFIRE in the infrared (e.g. Crossfield et al., 2013; Morris et al, 2016, in prep.). These emerging ground-based methods allow access to larger apertures and better time-sampling of transit lightcurves than equivalent HST methods. They therefore have the potential to observe transits at the precisions achievable from space but at a fraction of the cost and with the possibility of repeated measurements to further increase reliability. Importantly, ground-based telescopes have access to the full optical wavelength range and so will be highly complementary to JWST.

However, these ground-based methods are constrained by the need for similarly bright comparison stars in close neighborhood to the observed host star of the transiting system. In order to reduce instrumental systematics and optimize the time-sampling at the level needed for high-precision transit atmosphere observations, the comparison stars must be bright, of similar magnitude to the exoplanet host star and be within a few arcmin. 

To identify ideal candidates for ground-based characterization studies, we therefore we propose to use the single, visible wavelength instrument on board of K2 to obtain high-precision long cadence photometry on of the best suited pairs of similarly bright stars (mag < 11.5, separation < 5 arcmin). Assuming an occurrence of well-vetted planet candidates with P d 30 d of about ~2%, we expect to find ~20 planets that will be accessible for spectrophotometric atmospheric characterization from the ground.

The goal of high precision time resolved photometry is to reduce or in the best case remove all noise to achieve photon-noise limited photometry. After years of experience with these data a number of best practices for their handling have emerged: For the reduction and preparation of K2 data as well as for the planet search in the reduced data, we have access to a number of standard procedures that are already widely used in the community (e.g. the PyKe tools, Barclay & Still 2012; K2 specific best practices, Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015; or SIP, Angus et al. 2015). 

Finding these extremely valuable targets will enable us to do exactly the kind of basic research that advances our knowledge by characterization of planets and planetary systems outside of our Solar System in order to determine their compositions, dynamics, energetics, and chemical behaviors. The proposed study will directly support NASAs goal to Discover and study planets around other stars, in order to understand the underlying physical processes of exoplanets and to improve understanding of their origins.

Both are examples of the solar system's ""ocean worlds"" and stand as potential targets for future New Frontiers-class missions due to their relevance to understanding the diversity of habitable environments within the solar system and the potential emergence of life beyond Earth.

We propose to target both Titan and Enceladus for photometric monitoring with K2. They are on silicon for over 5 days during K2 Campaign 11. Observations from K2 will allow us to probe global atmospheric activity across Titan on short timescales continuously over the period of observability. This will provide unique temporal sampling and may highlight as-yet unseen physics in Titan's utterly unique atmosphere. Similarly, observations from K2 will allow us to search for photometric indications of Enceladus' plumes in backscattered light, and monitor them for variability on timescales much shorter than those probed by Cassini. These observations will constrain the size distribution of particles in Enceladus' plumes and may provide hints toward the sources of energy powering the plumes.

Both observations can serve as unique proofs of concept for space-based photometric monitoring of these outer solar system worlds, and will support the development of future missions to characterize them."
GO11101,11,Douglas,Russell,Gies,Georgia State University,gies@chara.gsu.edu,,A K2 Survey of Hot Massive Stars during Campaigns C11 and C13,"Introduction:
The NASA Kepler mission was a huge success for exoplanet detection and stellar astronomy. We obtained magnificent 
time series data that have led to remarkable new studies especially in the areas of asteroseismology, stellar 
rotational modulation, and binary and multiple stars. However, the Kepler field of view was selected away from the 
Galactic plane to avoid problems with blending in the crowded star fields close to the plane. Because the massive stars 
are generally young and form in the Galactic plane, the selection of a FOV away from the plane meant that very few massive 
stars were measured by Kepler (no O-type stars, for example). Now with K2 we have the opportunity to remedy the situation 
and follow the light curves of a significant sample of massive stars. First observations occurred during campaigns 
C0, C4, and C7, and now in C11 and C13, the K2 FOV is again located close to the galactic plane, so that massive star
targets are accessible.  This proposal describes the massive star sample and the kinds of scientific investigations that 
would be possible through such K2 photometric observations.

Sample:
I selected stars from the ""Catalogue of Stellar Spectral Classifications"" (Skiff, 2009-2014) that is available from
CDS Vizier.  A total of 176 and 27 targets were selected that are within the nominal boresight coordinates for C11 and 
C13, respectively, and confirmed to fall on the CCD detectors using the K2fov program. These stars have magnitudes in the
range V = 8 to 12.  They comprise a diverse collection of young stars, mainly of spectral types O and B and spanning 
all luminosity classes. The group includes a number of the rapidly rotating Be stars that eject gas into a circumstellar 
disk.  All these stars are ideal long cadence targets for continuous temporal coverage during the C11 and C13 campaigns, 
and we plan to obtain contemporaneous spectroscopy of them.

Eclipsing Binaries and Exoplanets:
Massive stars are rare, and consequently there are relatively few with well-established masses from combined spectroscopic 
and photometric analysis (Torres et al. 2010, A&ARv, 18, 67 note only four eclipsing systems containing O-type stars in 
their compendium of accurate eclipsing binary results).  Consequently, the identification of new eclipsing binaries 
would offer us important new targets for the determination of fundamental parameters. In addition, massive stars are 
often found in multiple systems, and the survey would help determine the incidence of massive stars with eclipsing 
binary companions. There are several known exoplanets that orbit host B-type stars, and the C11 and C13 campaigns offer
a superb opportunity to search for transiting planets that managed to form in the energetic radiation fields of the 
hot host stars.

Asteroseismology:
The early-type pulsating stars include the beta Cep class (p-mode), slowly pulsating B stars (g-mode), and periodically 
variable B and A-type supergiants. These pulsations are important probes of stellar interiors. The K2 sample will 
determine the incidence of pulsations and how multiple-mode beating may play a role in the gas ejection processes that 
lead to disk formation in the emission line Be stars.

Magnetic Fields and Rotational Modulation:
Massive stars generally have convective cores and radiative envelopes that are not usually associated with magnetic 
dynamos and field generation. Nevertheless, sensitive polarimetric surveys like the MiMeS project have led to the 
detection of magnetic fields in about 10% of the OB-stars. In these cases, the magnetic field can produce spots that 
introduce a rotational modulation in the light curve. The K2 survey will help determine the frequency of such 
rotational modulations and will provide a sample large enough to study the kinds of stellar parameters that are 
associated with magnetic fields."

We request Campaign 11 K2 monitoring to investigate accretion in the short period Supergiant
Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) IGR J17544-2619, the prototypical SFXT consisting of a neutron star (NS) in a ~4.9 d orbit around an O9 Ib donor star (Drave et al. 2014). The source shows large scale variability ~6 orders of magnitude 10^3110^38 erg s1 on timescales of hours
(Romano et al. 2015). This large dynamic range is suggestive of an accretion inhibition mechanism.
The maximum luminosity found by Romano et al. (2015) using Swift is near Eddington 
for a 1.4Msun NS, in variance with direct Bondi-Hoyle accretion where the
typical luminosity is ~10^3510^36 erg s1 (Chaty 2011). Different mechanisms have
been proposed to explain the mysterious accretion inhibition: the presence of large clumps in the
stellar wind (int Zand 2005; Walter & Zurita Heras 2007), magnetic gating mechanisms involving
NSs with rotation periods on the order of ~1000 s and magnetic fields on the order of
10^14 G (Bozzo et al. 2008), and the presence of a short-lived transient accretion disc (Romano et al.
2015). Of the mechanisms considered, the formation and dissipation of a transient accretion disc
resulting from a low-velocity high-density stellar wind might explain the giant outburst Romano
et al. (2015). While the presence of a cyclotron resonance scattering feature at ~17 keV suggesting
a magnetic field of ~10^12 G rules out a magnetar, the ingestion of a massive clump could also be
consistent with the variability seen in IGR J17544-2619 (Bhalerao et al. 2015).
For a complete understanding of accretion in Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients, comparing
data in different energy regimes is essential. A high precision optical campaign using K2 is
complimentary to long-term X-ray campaigns using INTEGRAL and Swift BAT and pointed X-ray
observations using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (Drave et al. 2014; Romano et al. 2015; Bhalerao et
al. 2015). While the X-ray data offers useful insights to probe the environment close to the NS, K2 optical data will reveal the mechanisms at work around the donor.

Methodology & Relevance
We request short cadence mode to investigate variability on orbital and sub-orbital timescales using
traditional Fourier analysis techniques and Dynamic Power Spectra. To search for the presence of a
transient accretion disc, we will cross-correlate the K2 optical data with X-ray data from Swift BAT.
We expect the optical data to lag the X-ray data, which could be attributed to reprocessing from the
donor or a possible transient accretion disc (Scaringi et al. 2015). We will monitor the behavior
of outbursts in the optical and X-ray using the discrete cross correlation function. Together,
these techniques could reveal insights on the physical processes that inhibits matter accretion in
prototypical SFXTs. The mechanism leading to the extreme dynamic range in luminosity found in
SFXTs remains mysterious. While different inhibition mechanisms were proposed to explain the
~10^3110^32 erg s1 low luminosity state, the ~10^38 erg s1 outburst found in IGR J17544-2619 is
puzzling.  Our use of Kepler's short cadence mode will investigate the behavior of matter accretion in extreme envirnoments, a key problem addressed in the Physics of the Cosmos.

Direct imaging surveys target young stars that are good candidates for hosting gas giant planets at 10s of AU separation and protoplanetary or debris disks. The stars in our sample are chosen from GPIES (Macintosh et al. 2013), SPHERE (Bezuit et al. 2008), NICI (Wahaj et al. 2013, Nielsen et al., 2013, Biller et al., 2013), and SEEDS (Brandt et al. 2014) public target lists. They have been age-dated primarily by lithium, placement on the HR diagram, or by association to moving groups at young ages. 

The inferred properties of planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions discovered through direct imaging are often model dependent (e.g. Burrows et al. 1997, Baraffe et al. 2003), relying heavily on their age estimates. Identifying older systems that appear young from other estimates will improve the analysis of any circumstellar material (including companions), as well as survey statistics regarding the overall population and formation trends of long-period planets. Additionally, the stellar magnetic field environment can affect orbit evolution of companions as well as dust grain properties in disks. The stellar properties of direct imaging targets are an important component of understanding planet forming populations. 

Our program has three major goals, (1) to find potentially misidentified stellar ages in our sample through asteroseismology, (2) to measure stellar rotation periods to combine with radial velocity measurements from other facilities, and (3) to detect stellar flares in order to better understand the circumstellar environments where planets form and disks evolve. As more direct imaging target stars are monitored with K2, comparing their existing age estimates with newly measured rotational properties can help to explain angular momentum loss in young stars that may host planets. 

We propose short cadence observations in order to detect variations due to seismic activity and resolve detailed morphology of stellar flares. These observations will also provide rotational periods for each of our targets. Combining rotation rates with vsini measurements will resolve the inclination of the stellar axis for systems with potential planetary mass companions and/or disks. Measuring flaring properties of the stars in our sample will indicate the magnetic fields present in the circumstellar region, which is an important component to fully understanding the planet formation process. Finally, asteroseismology may be able to identify stars that are older than other age-dating methods have suggested."

Our knowledge of these processes is very limited, and this lack of understanding results in large uncertainties on current stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars. As these models are important cornerstones for several fields of modern astrophysics (e.g., chemical enrichment of galaxies, stellar life cycles and their effects on star and planetary system formation, dynamics of stellar clusers, etc.), these shortcomings need to be resolved.

Asteroseismology is one of the few tools that allow us to study the interiors of stars by the interpretation of their pulsation signal. The last decade brought an immense revolution to the field thanks to the succes of space telescopes such as CoRoT and Kepler, and thanks to vast improvements of asteroseismological techniques. The frequency spectra of the pulsating beta Cep and slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are strongly influenced by the mentioned mixing processes (e.g., Miglio et al. 2008, MNRAS, 386, 1487), which makes them ideal asteroseismic probes.

Even in the era of space-based telescopes, observations of OB stars are a rarity, not only because of their relatively low number compared to Solar-like and KM dwarves, but also because they are preferably avoided by missions driven by exoplanet detections. While the nominal Kepler mission delivered a revolution in stellar physics for Solar-like stars and red giants, it only added a few stars to the still less than two dozens of OB dwarves where in-depth studies managed to put at least some constraints on the extent of the overshoot region around the core, or on the internal rotation profile (Aerts 2015, IAUS, 307, 154A). Even more striking is that there is only one star where a full actual seismic modelling was carried out based on gravity modes, resulting in stringent constraints on the core overshoot (Papics et al. 2014, A&A, 570, A8) and the diffusive mixing (Moravveji et al. 2015, A&A, 580, A27), culminating in an inversion of the internal rotation profile (Triana et al. 2015, ApJ, 810, 16). The few available observational studies have demonstrated that the richness of variable behaviour among these stars is so large that the details in their internal physics must be different. This means that we need to map the whole extent of the instability strip with in-depth seismic modelling efforts to find the connection between the fundamental parameters and the internal mixing properties of these stars. This is the only way we can calibrate the stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars.

We propose the observation of 35 potential B-type pulsators, that have been selected based on spectral type and brightness. We propose stars where we can conduct simultaneous and follow-up observations with the high-resolution HERMES spectrograph and the 3-channel MAIA CCD camera installed on the 1.2 meter Mercator Telescope on La Palma (operated by the host institute of the PI).

Our methodology is as follows: we do frequency analysis on the detrended K2 data, then we attempt mode identification using period- and frequency-spacing patterns, or  if this is not possible  using multicolour photometry or time-resolved high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. This is followed by forward modelling of the zonal modes. We iterate over theoretical frequency sets calculated using different input physics to fine-tune the equilibrium models until we reach the best fit. This will result in a new generation of stellar structure models. There might be stars that are found to be non pulsating, but these non-detections coupled with precise spectroscopy will be also very useful to validate the current excitation calculations, especially since at the moment the predicted instability strips on the HRD are still very undersampled in terms of observational data."
GO11109,11,Bram,D,Buysschaert,"Institute for Astronomy, KU Leuven",bram.buysschaert@ster.kuleuven.be,"Aerts, Conny Clara; Neiner, Coralie; Oksala, Mary Elizabeth; Briquet, Maryline",K2 Asteroseismology of hot magnetic stars,"About 10% of hot stars host a magnetic field at their stellar surface, detectable with current ground-based spectropolarimeters (Grunhut & Neiner 2015,IAUS,305,53). The interaction of these fields with certain layers deep inside the star and influence internal physical processes is poorly understood, and can alter the efficiency of the internal mixing of chemical species or have a crucial role in angular momentum transport. Therefore, magnetic fields are important for the stellar structure and evolution of a significant number of hot stars.

We thus use asteroseismology to probe the stellar interior by studying their stellar pulsations. Tremendous progress in asteroseismology has been made over the last decade, with space-based missions providing a vast amount of data, and significantly improved seismic techniques. However, the number of hot magnetic pulsators studied with high precision space-based photometry is limited.

Theoretically, magnetic Ap/Bp stars should exhibit various pulsational behaviours (see Aerts et al. 2010, Springer, for a detailed overview). Bp and late A stars host heat-driven gravity modes, SPB and gamma Dor pulsators, respectively, probing the core region of the star. Pulsating early A stars are either classified as roAp stars or as delta Sct pulsators, which probe the outer regions of the star. The former exhibit high-order stochastic magneto-acoustic modes, while the latter have low-order pressure modes. Those heat-driven modes, observed with a high precision thanks to the long timebase, are necessary to perform successful seismic and stellar modelling, inferring the connection between stellar magnetic fields and their internal properties.

The magnetic fields observed in 10% of hot stars, and in particular in all Ap/Bp stars, are of fossil origin, i.e. remnants from the magnetic field of the original molecular cloud from which the star formed, possibly enhanced by a dynamo during the very early stages of stellar evolution. These fields have a simple configuration, most often a dipole inclined to the rotation axis. Magnetic fields are also responsible for peculiar chemical surface abundances. Combining magnetic information with a seismic study enables us to put strong constraints on stellar models, providing information about the stellar surface, through the magnetic study and the deep interior through asteroseismology. Moreover, comparing the amount of mixing obtained by asteroseismology for magnetic hot stars with that of non-magnetic objects would allow us to corroborate or disprove the theoretical prediction that magnetic fields inhibit mixing in stellar interiors.

At present, only two magnetic pulsating stars have been studied in such a detailed manner, beta Cep (Shibahasi & Aerts 2000,ApJ,531,L143) and V2052 Oph (Briquet et al. 2012,MNRAS,27,483). Although magnetic fields have been detected in a number of other pulsating stars, there has been no detailed seismic modelling, due to the current lack of either asteroseismic data for those stars or modelling of their magnetic field with this proposal, we aim to increase better understand how the stellar magnetic field influences non-standard mixing processes governing the interior of hot stars. Moreover, by combining this study with other K2 campaigns, we will reach a statistically significant number of hot magnetic stars.

The photometric accuracy and the high duty-cycle of K2 is best suited to reach our science goals. State-of-the-art modelling tools will translate seismic information to detailed stellar models. Spectropolarimetric observations will be obtained with ESPaDOnS or Narval. In total, 14 hot magnetic stars are observable in Fields 11 to 13. Although the proposed targets might show variability on short timescales, we can work with long cadence data to study the low order p modes and all possible g modes, as demonstrated by Saio et al.2015 (MNRAS,444,3264)."

In particular, in the past few years a new sub-class has been recognized in the ""transitional"" binary millisecond pulsars. These are millisecond pulsars in binary systems with a low-mass companion star, that are observed to swing between an accretion powered (X-ray pulsar) and a rotation powered (radio pulsar) state, and their recent discovery provided the conclusive evidence of the evolutionary link between these two classes of sources. Three transitional binary millisecond pulsars are known to date, and other potential members are recognized to be possibly hosted among the red-back and black-widow binaries, namely binary pulsars whose donor star is currently loosing mass. Enlarging the number of systems caught in this transitional phase is certainly needed to test binary evolution theories, and to study the disk-field interaction over a large range of mass accretion rates. 

Here we propose to exploit  the capabilities of Kepler/K2, and specifically ask to observe three targets Campaign 11: the globular cluster Terzan 5 (hosting several systems), the black-widow PSR J1731-1847, and the red-back PSR J1723-2837 (which are the only visible targets of this king in the K2 cycle 4 campaigns).  The three months long K2 campaign will lead to the most comprehensive study of optical aperiodic variability in these sources so far. Moreover, it will provide us with the unique opportunity to detect the 1-2 mag variations of the optical flux that is associated to transition between the radio pulsar (fainter) and the sub-luminous (brighter) disk state. We will then be able to determine (or provide more stringent constraints on) the still poorly understood timescales and dynamics of the state transitions of these puzzling systems."

Space data of these crucial objects have led to a giant leap forward in our understanding of their structure and evolution through the discovery of new dynamical phenomena. Moreover, insight into these stars dynamics is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond.
Throughout the K2 Mission we have been building up a unique database of high precision RR Lyrae light curves from field to field, covering different parts of our Galaxy, and beyond. Our strategy assures that galactic structure studies and statistical analysis of pulsation properties (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko modulation, period doubling, low-dimensional chaos, non-radial modes) based on K2 data will be possible. Besides the ensemble studies, the boutique analysis of individual stars will be equally interesting and important. 

Targets
---------
Field 11 covers parts of the bulge where tens of thousands of RR Lyrae stars reside. For this proposal we selected about 1200 stars based on the OGLE-IV survey and an additional 400 stars from other sources covering the rest of the field of view. The OGLE survey discovered many stars with peculiar pulsation and modulation properties. Low-amplitude additional modes have been observed in all RR Lyrae subtypes, but their origins and occurrence rates are still largely unknown. We also included modulated RRc stars in the list. While the Blazhko effect in fundamental-mode stars has been studied extensively from space, the sample of modulated RRc stars is still scarce.  

In Field 12 we selected about 200 stars. 8 RR Lyrae stars were previously observed during the K2-E2 Engineering Test run, including a fundamental-mode star where we tentatively identified a frequency component as a g-mode signal. Re-observation of these targets present a unique opportunity to reassess our earlier findings that were based on only 9 days of data. It will also show us how did the accuracy of Kepler evolve since the early tests.  
For a number of RR Lyrae stars extensive multicolor photometry is available from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Field survey. The detailed color information will be a valuable addition to the K2 light curves. Beside the RR Lyrae stars, we also found an additional 30 variables belonging to various classes that we also include in this proposal.   

Field 13, towards the Galactic anticenter direction, contains 103 known RR Lyrae stars. One priority target here is BR Tau that has a short modulation period of only ~19 days. 

Methods and planned community resources
---------------------------------------------------
Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. Metallicities will be derived from empirical relations calibrated with high-resolution spectra. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations.
Photometry of large-amplitude pulsators require special treatment, and general-purpose pipelines may provide RR Lyrae light curves with sub-optimal quality. We already released tailor-made photometry from some Kepler data sets. We intend to create custom light curves for the stars listed in this proposal too, and plan to employ special methods like differential-image photometry for the bulge field. As a value-added community resource we envisage a searchable database containing the light curves, frequency solutions and other parameters (Blazhko periods, additional modes, etc.) of the RR Lyrae stars observed by K2."
GO11112,11,Coralie,,Neiner,Observatoire de Paris-Meudon,coralie.neiner@obspm.fr,"Saio, Hideyuki; Oksala, Mary Elizabeth; Mathis, Stephane; Lee, Umin; Buysschaert, Bram D",Understanding classical Be stars thanks to K2_x005F_x005Fs Fields 11 and 13,"Classical Be stars are rapidly-rotating pulsating hot stars that host a circumstellar disk created from matter ejected by the star through sporadic events. How these ejections occur is not understood yet, but they are most likely related to the very rapid stellar rotation and their pulsations. The correlation between pulsations and the ejections of matter was first proposed by Rivinius et al. (2001) and firmly established by Huat et al. (2009) thanks to CoRoT observations.
CoRoT observed a few bright Be stars and allowed us to progress significantly on this issue. In particular, sub-inertial gravito-inertial (gi) modes, which are stochastically-excited in the convective core, have been detected in HD51452 (Neiner et al. 2012). In addition, stochastically-excited low-frequency g modes have been observed with CoRoT in HD49330 during an outburst (Huat et al. 2009). These g modes are only visible during the outburst and probably excited just below the surface, while the kappa-driven p modes get destabilized at that time. It was not expected that stochastically-excited gi modes could be observed in hot stars (Samadi et al. 2010). However, Be stars are very rapid rotators and stochastic excitation is enhanced by rapid rotation, through the Coriolis acceleration. This has been demonstrated analytically (Mathis et al. 2014) and observed in numerical simulations (Rogers et al. 2013). Such stochastic modes are thus probably present in all rapidly rotating hot stars.
In addition, Lee (2013) showed that gi modes excited by the kappa mechanism transport angular momentum and could play a role in the Be phenomenon. Our recent work shows that transport by trapped sub-inertial waves may be sustained in rapidly rotating stars thanks to the stronger stochastic excitation by turbulent convective flows. Moreover, sub-inertial gi modes have very low frequencies and therefore they transport more angular momentum than modes with higher frequencies. We thus proposed that this mechanism allows to transport angular momentum from the convective core of Be stars to their surface. The accumulation of angular momentum just below the surface of Be stars increases the surface velocity, which then reaches the critical velocity needed to eject material from the star (Neiner et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2015).
Unfortunately, the nominal Kepler mission did not observe classical Be stars and only 14 Be stars were observed so far in K2 fields. We propose to observe the additional 4 classical Be stars available in Fields 11 and 13, in long cadence mode. We have already developed tools to construct light-curves from the provided pixel data and to correct for any remaining effects of the roll of the satellite (Buysschaert et al. 2015). The data of previous fields are currently being analyzed and will be combined with the Fields 11-13 data, to test the scenario devised from CoRoT observations.
Our first goal is to investigate whether the observed classical Be stars show stochastic gi modes in addition to the kappa-driven g and p pulsation modes, to confirm that these gi modes are common in Be stars and are a signature of the Be phenomenon. Second, we will apply the seismic modelling tool we recently developed to model the kappa-driven and stochastic gi modes. We will then be able to compute the transport of angular momentum from the core of the Be stars to their surface. If this angular momentum transport is sufficient, it would confirm our proposed scenario that gi modes are those that enhance the transport of momentum, leading the surface layer to reach critical velocity and thus igniting the ejection of material to the Keplerian circumstellar disk.
In addition, for 2 Be stars observed with CoRoT it has been possible to derive the extent of the convective core (Neiner et al. 2012). This is very important to quantify the effect of rapid rotation on the internal structure of stars. We expect that this will also be possible for most classical Be stars observed with K2."
GO11113,11,Ehsan,,Moravveji,KU Leuven,Ehsan.Moravveji@ster.kuleuven.be,"Pollard, Karen Rylvia; de Mink, Selma E; Sana, Hugues AA; Aerts, Conny Clara; Moya, Andy; Simon-Diaz, Sergio; Castro, Norberto; Buysschaert, Bram D; Kambe, Eiji; Saio, Hideyuki",UPBEAT: Unravelling Pulsations of BluE supergiAnTs,"Introduction. Blue Supergiant (BSG) stars are early-type massive (>3 Msun) stars found at their post-main sequence evolution phase. Due to their impact on galactic evolution (triggering starburst, and metal enrichment) they are critical objects to study. Several physical aspect of BSG evolution is still poorly understood; specifically, there is no clear census of binarity among BSGs. As young objects, they reside predominantly in the Galactic plane. Surface He and CNO abundances in BSGs exhibit a significant excess compared to their main sequence progenitors, rendering the rotational mixing a plausible explanation (Przybilla et al. 2010, A&A). BSGs exhibit photometric and spectroscopic variabilities (see Moravveji et al. 2012a, ApJ, for an example) due to radial/nonradial oscillations, episodic mass loss (Aerts et al. 2010, A&ALett), rotating spot(s) at the photosphere, and/or ellipsoidal variability possibly due to the presence of a close companion. UPBEAT aims to characterise and quantify these variability mechanisms involved in Galactic BSGs by combining K2 space photometry with time-resolved ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy.

Feasibility. The K2 photometry of 10 BSGs in the engineering Field 0 proved that this instrument is capable of detecting BSG varibilities. Thus, the unique capabilities of K2 is well suited for our proposed project. The Campaign 0 provided only ~30 days of useful data for asteroseismic purposes (see e.g. Buysschaert et al. 2015, MNRAS). This limitation is improved by the instrument pointing stability and the ~80 day contiguous observations since Field 2. Thus, the resulting light curves will not suffer from daily aliasing, and is quite optimal for characterization of BSG variabilities. The K2's point-to-point photometric scatter is ~50 ppm. Based on our experience with BSGs in Campaign 0, K2 photometry is precise enough to characterise and quantify flux variability due to different underlying reasons. Thus, UPBEAT can feasibly exploit K2's capabilities.

Impact. During Campaign 11, K2 visits the Galactic plane (maybe for the last time). This is a unique and time-critical opportunity, because the next planned mission to deliver such high-quality uninterrupted space photometry is PLATO, to be launched after ~2024. The ~8 year observation gap between now and 2024 can only be filled with K2. Space photometry of BSGs, at the precision and cadence offered by K2, is scarce; thus, K2 will leave a valuable legacy data behind for scrutinizing the physics of the upper Herzsprung-Russel diagram for the next decade(s). UPBEAT seizes this opportunity by focusing on a sample of Galactic BSGs.

Objectives. We have already proposed 38 BSGs for the Campaign 9 (DDT); by the time we are submitting this proposal, we are still unaware of the NASA/K2 peer-review decision. Here, we propose observation of additional 40 OB-type BSGs between Kp=8 and 16 magnitude in fields 11, 12 and 13. We guarantee high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy with HERMES@Mercator for targets with Kp <12, and spectroscopic monitoring for those brighter than Kp ~10 mag. We will use other instruments (UVES@VLT and/or HDS@Subaru) for targets fainter than Kp ~12 mag. The combined photometry and spectroscopy will be used to (a) identify or exclude pulsation variability, (b) draw the observational instability strips, and confront that with our predictions (Moravveji 2016, MNRAS) (c) explore the pulsation excitation mechanism (epsilon- versus kappa-mechanism, Moravveji et al. 2012b, ApJ). (d) carry out iterative frequency prewhitening, and search for regularities in frequency and/or periods, (e) characterize possible rotating spots, (f) test the hypothesis that macroturbulence velocity has pulsation origin, (g) trace the surface chemical and rotational velocity evolution, with a possible link to rotational and/or non-rotational mixing processes, and (h) disentangle apparent single stars versus close binaries."
GO11114,11,Andras,,Pal,MTA CsFK,apal@szofi.net,"Szabo, Robert; Mueller, Thomas G; Kiss, Laszlo; Kiss, Csaba",K2 photometry of a large sample of trans-Neptunian objects,"Our recent studies (Pal et al. 2015, 2016, Kiss et al 2016) have demonstrated that the K2 mission is an excellent opportunity to obtain rotational properties of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Using long-cadence Kepler photometry focusing on the stationary points of the apparent tracks of these objects, light curves with excellent quality can be obtained, from which one can constrain the rotation period, surface inhomogeneities, the shape of the object and decide, whether the true rotation period corresponds to a single-peaked or double-peaked solution.

We propose to observe 13+9+9 Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects throughout the Campaigns 11, 12 and 13, respectively, of the K2 programme. From our list of proposed targets, 8 also have been observed in the framework of the ``TNOs are Cool!'' open-time key programme of the Herschel Space Observatory (Muller et al. 2009), therefore an unambiguous rotational characteristics can be combined with an unambiguous diameter and surface albedo for these objects. This sample of ours covers various dynamical types of the population of objects outside the main asteroid belt, including 5 Centaurs, 13 classical objects, 4 scattered disk objects and 9 resonant objects. One of the resonant objects has 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune (namely 2012 VU85, a Trojan of Neptune) as well as there are four Plutinos, i.e. objects in 2:3 mean-motion resonance with Neptune.

None of targets having Herschel/PACS thermal photometry have a currently known accurate rotation period (note: 2005 TB190 has ground-based observations confirming variability but with several aliases, see also Thirouin et al. 2012). Hence, the K2 time series also aids the proper interpretation of thermal emission measurements. All of the targets having Herschel photometry fall on silicon for quite long time (60+ days) with the exception of Borasisi. This object is a binary system with a period of 46.3 days (Noll et al. 2004). Hence, the total time of 13+10 days when K2 is capable to perform photometry would not cover the binary period, however, even this shorter track could confirm or constrain whether the objects have a synchronous rotation or not.

Due to the number of these targets and the comparatively large pixel cost w.r.t the stellar sources, we prioritize our targets according to their brightness (i.e. the effective S/N ratio of the rotational light curve) as well as the existence of thermal infrared data. Our top priority objects include all of the objects having Herschel/PACS photometry. We also indicated 2012 VU85 with priority 1. Priority 2 objects are either bright or have interesting dynamical properties. We note that even the faintest (priority 3) objects have comparable brightness to that of 2002 GV31. This object was also successfully observed by K2, yielding a folded light curve with good signal-to-noise ratio and an unambiguous rotation period (Pal et al. 2015). We also note that the first minor body discovered in the outer Solar System, (2060) Chiron fell on silicon during Campaign 12. Due to the different nature of K2 data acquisition, the science case of (2060) Chiron is described in a separate proposal.

Photometric studies of LMXBs have revealed their strong optical variability, due to both the orbital modulation produced by the secondary star and the accretion disk instabilities, which can dramatically increase their optical brightness. Long-term monitoring of LMXBs allows us to study both orbital and super-orbital variability (typical LMXBs orbital periods last from hours to days). Uninterrupted, long-term observations are not possible with ground-based telescopes. Thus, the Kepler K2 mission can provide an unprecedented view of accretion processes onto neutron stars (NS) and black holes (BHs).

The prototypical NS LMXB (Sco X-1) has already been observed in previous campaigns of the K2 mission (Scaringi et al. 2015, Hakala et al. 2015). They measure both optical lags and rapid transitions between optical high and low states, probing both the feasibility and fruitfulness of this kind of studies. We propose to observe LMXBs in Campaign 11 field of view. From an initial sample of 19 systems, five LMXBs in K2 Campaign 11 remain after discarding sources without optical/near-infrared counterparts as well as those where source confusion prevents proper identification. The target selection (five sources) includes: a transient BH (V2107 Oph, target 1), one transient NS (XTE J1710-281, target 2), a transient BH candidate (GRO J1719-24, target 3) and two persistent NSs (4U 1728-16 and 3A 1728-247; targets 4 and 5 respectively). The analysis of these LMXBs will result in very complementary studies of different populations representatives. 

We will i) measure the orbital period on transient systems which still lack a proper determination (target 3, a BH candidate not yet well studied); as well as ii) determine the ellipsoidal modulation for those whose period is already known (target 1 and 2, a BH candidate and a NS system respectively). The ellipsoidal modulation is critical as it is one of the few ways to determine the elusive inclination angle, which usually dominates de error budget on mass determinations. In particular, the only ellipsoidal studies of target 1 were performed 20 years ago (Martin et al. 1995; Remillard et al. 1996) using poor resolution light curves; and they are most likely affected by fast flickering and needs revisiting. In addition, target 2 has already shown X-ray eclipses (Jain & Paul 2008), and therefore a large amplitude ellipsoidal modulation (due to its high inclination) is expected. On the other hand, (iii) persistent systems (targets 4 and 5, both with NS) are known to exhibit different optical states, which can be characterized using K2 light curves (see Scaringi et al. 2015, Hakala et al. 2015)."

The first of our three objectives is construct catalogs of transiting planets in the magnitude-limited samples of K2 fields.  These catalogs enable diverse follow-up observations and analyses by our team and others.  Second, we aim to discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  Our third goal is to use the planet catalogs to measure variations in the occurrence rate of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood. We already see differences between the populations of planets orbiting nearby stars and stars in the prime Kepler Field.  For example, hot Jupiters are 2.5 times less abundant in the Kepler Field (Howard et al. 2012).  We have to wonder if the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone (Petigura et al. 2013) is similarly reduced relative to nearby stars. With this proposal we will measure the occurrence of detectable, short-period super-Earths and Neptune-size planets (~2-3 Earth-radii). 

This Cycle 4 request for Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in C0-C10 (PIs Howard, Sanchis-Ojeda, Petigura, and Winn) that constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.  We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts.  Here we request magnitude-limited samples (Kp < 14) of Fields 11-13 comprising approximately 10,000 stars per field.

We will continue our search for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013).  We catalog the planets discovered, their orbital and physical properties, and their host star characteristics.  We compute the occurrence rates of small, close-in planets using injection-and-recovery tests to account for the sensitivity of TERRA and will report the field-to-field variability and overall rates of planet occurrence. Assuming a precision of 80 ppm over 6.5 hours, a 2 Earth-radii planet with P = 20-day is detectable at SNR = 8 during a single 75-day K2 campaign.  Based on the prime mission occurrence statistics, we expect to find 3 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with P < 20 days per 1,000 stars observed. As validated by our searches of K2 photometry from Campaigns 0-2, a sample of 8,000 stars is expected to yield ~25 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with orbital periods less than 20 days, providing an occurrence measurement with 25% fractional uncertainty. With 8,000 stars, we will be sensitive to factor-of-two variations in the occurrence rate of 2-3 Earth-radii planets at 4-sigma significance.  In addition, we will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES and other facilities. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultra-short-period Earths. Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission."

astrophysics, and solving this will have significant ramifications for our understanding of how other galaxies form and evolve. Success
will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution.
This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the
solar neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used
Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential
for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.
RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar
samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program
for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to
those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.
AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (on average ~5000 per campaign) to
probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to
make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys
structure and evolution from its stellar populations.
METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by
ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use
our seismic inferred stellar properties to stresstest state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."
GO11125,11,Marica,,Valentini,Kepler Guest Observer Office,mvalentini@aip.de,"Miglio, Andrea; Chiappini, Cristina; Anders, Friedrich; Montalban, Josefina; Barbuy, Beatriz",The age of Galactic Bulge/Thick disk field stars in the metal-poor metallicity distribution tail,"MOTIVATION: The detection of chemical imprints left by the first stars has a key role in the understanding the chemical and physical conditions of the early Universe. Most of the current observational efforts in finding the chemical imprints left by the first stars have focused on the most metal-poor stars found in the MW halo. However, studies based on the chemical and kinematic properties of stars in the different MW components have shown that not only the halo, but also the bulge and thick disk are potential hosts of the oldest stars in our Galaxy.
By studying the heavy element content of few stars in the oldest MW GC NGC6522, located in the Galactic Bulge, Chiappini et al. (2001) and Barbuy et al. (2014) suggested that Bulge stars at moderately low metallicites are as old as the oldest halo stars, which are 100 times more metal poor ([Fe/H] = -3).
 Obviously, no age measurements are available for any of the red giants studied in these works.
 As the correspondence between age and metallicity is strongly dependent on the star formation history of the particular studied component, it is crucial to confirm that moderately metal poor Bulge stars are very old and hence born from an interstellar medium essentially enriched by the first stellar generations of massive stars. This confirmation can be performed by measuring with high precision the ages and abundances of field red giants in the Bulge. As only asteroseismic measurements will be able to provide precise ages for these distant red giants, this is an opportunity not to be missed by K2. The feasibility and the impact of the use of asteroseismology coupled with spectroscopy have been confirmed by recent works in the field of Galactic Archeology (i.e. Chiappini et al. 2015).

RELEVANCE: The derivation of precise and accurate abundances and ages for Bulge field stars is hampered by the difficulties of observing in such obscured region (Eb-V reaching 1) and of determining ages for red giants (difficulties in determining atmospheric parameters plus degeneracies in the HR diagram in the RG locus). A dedicated program combining asteroseismology with K2 and spectroscopy will avoid such limitations, providing an ambitious and new dataset where to look for the imprints of first stars. This will be the only opportunity to confirm/discard the old ages of distant field Red Giant Bulge stars. So far, ages of bulge field stars were obtained only for lensed dwarf stars (Bensby et al. 2013). If confirmed that bulge stars of moderate low metallicity (1/10th solar) are indeed very old, this will open a new window into the study of the fossil records containing the chemical imprints of the first stellar generations.

AIM: We selected our targets from the APOGEE DR13 catalog. By applying a selection in gravity (following K-2 performances, Stello et al. 2015) and in metallicity ([M/H]<-0.5), we identified 30 field Red Giants useful for our project.

GO11126,11,Marica,,Valentini,Kepler Guest Observer Office,mvalentini@aip.de,"Ortolani, Sergio; Chiappini, Cristina; Miglio, Andrea; Anders, Friedrich; Montalban, Josefina; Bica, Eduardo Luiz Damiani; Barbuy, Beatriz; Cantelli, Elvis",The age of moderately metal-poor stars in Bulge Globular Clusters _x005F_x005F Campaign 11,"MOTIVATION: Most of the current observational efforts in finding the chemical imprints left by the first stars have focused on the most metal-poor stars found in the MW halo. However, studies based on the chemical and kinematic properties of stars in the different MW components have shown that not only the halo, but also the bulge and thick disk are potential hosts of the oldest stars in our Galaxy. 
By studying the heavy element content of few stars in the oldest MW GC NGC6522, located in the Galactic Bulge, Chiappini et al. (2001) and Barbuy et al. (2014) suggested that Bulge stars at moderately low metallicites are as old as the oldest halo stars, which are 100 times more metal poor ([Fe/H] = -3). Obviously, no age measurements are available for any of the red giants studied in these works. As the correspondence between age and metallicity is strongly dependent on the star formation history of the particular studied component, it is crucial to confirm that moderately metal poor Bulge stars are very old and hence born from an interstellar medium essentially enriched by the first stellar generations of massive stars. This confirmation can be performed by measuring with high precision the ages and abundances of red giants in moderately metal poor Bulge Globular Clusters. Two metal-poor Bulge Globular Clusters are present in the K2 C11 field: Pal 6 and NGC 6355. As only asteroseismic measurements will be able to provide precise ages for these distant red giants, this is an opportunity not to be missed by K2. The feasibility and the impact of the use of asteroseismology coupled with spectroscopy have been confirmed by recent works in the field of Galactic Archaeology (i.e. Chiappini et al. 2015).

RELEVANCE: The derivation of precise and accurate abundances and ages for red giants in Bulge Globular Clusters is hampered by the lack of the knowledge about extinction and ages for red giants (difficulties in determining atmospheric parameters plus degeneracies in the HR diagram the RG locus). A dedicated program combining asteroseismology with K2 and spectroscopy will avoid such limitations, providing an ambitious and new dataset where to look for the imprints of first stars. This will be the only opportunity to confirm/discard the old ages of Red Giant Bulge stars in Globular Clusters of moderate metallicities ([Fe/H] ~ -1). With this project we open a new window into the study of the fossil records of the first stellar generations.

AIM: Here we aim at observing a rather small sample (5-10 targets per cluster) of Red Giants in NGC 6355 and Pal 6 during  C11. Most of the stars already have secured spectroscopic follow-up by our group. The light curves, obtained from this campaign, will lead us to obtain fundamental seismic information. With this data we aim to a) confirm that Bulge stars of moderately low metallicities are very old objects, as old as the oldest halo stars observed ; and b) analyse the chemical pattern of the oldest objects in order to establish if there are imprints left by the first stellar generations. A parallel pilot project will be carried for field stars, which have already APOGEE spectra.

METHODOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine the radius and the mass of each stars using asteroseismology. This information will be complemented by already secured ground-based spectroscopy (individual bulge globular cluster studies of Barbuy and collaborators). It will be therefore possible to determine precise distances (and hence reddening) and precise model-dependent ages for each target.  Finally, the inferred ages together with key abundance indicators, will be combined in order to identify possible imprints of the first stellar generations left in the oldest stars in the Galactic Bulge."

We propose the characterization of Be stars in K2 fields 11, 12 and 13. Classical Be stars are rapid rotators of spectral type B and luminosity class V-III which have an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk. The disk often exhibits Balmer emission lines and an infrared excess fed by discrete mass loss events called outbursts. In spite of their high V sin i, rapid rotation alone cannot explain
the ejection episodes as most Be stars do not rotate at their critical rotation rates. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations have been analyzed to demonstrate short-term variations are rather common among early-type Be stars. The observed line profile variability (LPV) is characterized by moving bumps traveling from blue to red across the line profile on timescales ranging from minutes to a few days. Non-radial pulsations (NRP) have been proposed as an explanation of the LPV observed in hot stars. NRP
produce LPV thanks to the combination of the Doppler displacement of stellar surface elements with their associated temperature variations due to the compression/expansion caused by the passage of waves through the photosphere. NRP could be the additional mechanism required for a rapidly rotating B star to become a Be star, that is to trigger the Be phenomenon by means of mass ejection (Rivinius et al. 1998).
2. High-precision photometry and pulsation periods.
Huat et al. (2009) found for the Be HD 49330 from CoRoT and ground-based spectroscopic data an increase in amplitude for g-modes and a decrease for p-modes just before an outburst. Neiner et al. (2012) discovered gravito-inertial modes in the Be star HD 51452. They found that the mode amplitudes were linked to the presence of mini outbursts. In general, hot Be stars display nonradial pressure pulsation modes, whereas cooler ones display gravity modes. Despite those empirical evidences, the physical processes responsible for the outbursts and mass loss in Be stars are still poorly understood. Dziembowski et al. (2007) showed that high-order g-modes driven by the kappa mechanism are unstable in the region of the HR diagram occupied by Be stars. The predicted radial velocity amplitude
due to an l=3 g-mode is ~ 20 km/s for a star with 4 solar masses, with pulsation periods in the range ~0.51.1 days. For more massive and hotter stars like HD 171219, unstable modes are found with periods of 0.5-2 days.
3. Methods and proposed targets
Pulsation analysis of a star requires the measurement of frequencies with both high photometric precision and high time-frequency resolution. Only space missions provide both conditions. Since NRP in Be stars have periods near 1.0 cycles per day, Kepler observations are especially important to avoid the frequency aliases due to the day/night cycle of ground observations. Another advantage of Kepler data is the continuous observations for months with a 30 min cadence that improves the chances to observe outburst events in our targets. Stellar seismology made a great leap forward thanks to the MOST, CoRoT and Kepler satellites.  Our targets have Kp between 4.4 and 15.7 Long cadence (30 min) is desirable for this research. We aim to have both Kepler photometric time-series and simultaneous ground spectroscopic observations in the first month of kepler observations to measure Be periodicities and understand the Be phenomenon. Our proposal fits the Small category, and the number of our targets will be under 300. Our group have experience with asteroseismology and have already worked in the same analysis with CoRoT data, and have targets been observed in K2 cycle 3.
4. Significance
Be stars, as easy-to-observe objects giving a privileged peek into the structure of rapidly rotating stars, are therefore among the best suited laboratories to investigate important problems in contemporary astrophysics, like the effects of rapid rotation on stellar evolution."

These parts (the bulge, thick disk, thin disk, halo) feature distinct stellar populations, and understanding the properties of those populations is an ongoing effort. Studying these properties relies on reliable fundamental parameters of stars: their masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities. Eclipsing binary stars lend themselves naturally to this task, since their favorable geometrical orientation and basic laws of gravity enable us to determine fundamental parameters to a ~1% accuracy. We scoured the published catalogs and proprietary KELT and SuperWASP data for all eclipsing binary stars in K2 C11, C12 and C13 fields. We propose to observe these stars and, along with other serendipitous discoveries of binarity in the fields, build a stellar population model based on the fundamental parameters derived from K2 data and follow-up multi-color photometry and spectroscopy. Studying the intrinsic differences in stellar populations across K2 fields will allow us to infer the dependence on galactic latitude and contribute to our understanding of stellar population distribution in our Galaxy."
GO12004,12,Gavin,,Ramsay,Armagh Observatory,gar@arm.ac.uk,"Doyle, John Gerard",A survey of M/L flare stars,"Flares are seen from stars of various spectral types including our Sun.  However, flares from stars with a much lower mass than our Sun are more common than higher mass stars. At the start of K2 we initiated a project to observe a stars with M/L spectral type to determine how the flare activity depends on parameters such as mass, rotation period, age and hence a better understanding of the
underlying physics which produce flares. A second key goal is to assess how correlated flares are with the stellar rotational phase. Kepler observations indicate that at least some flare stars do not show a correlation but do show a characteristic rotational modulation. This is difficult to explain since the modulation is expected to be due to starspots rotating into and out of view which should produce a correlation between phase and flare rate. Our work will also have implications for determining how flares can effect the atmosphere of any exoplanets in the stellar system. Our target selection will cover the M (and early L) spectral types. We bid for observatios of 4, 3 and 10 known flare stars in Fields 11, 12 and 13 respectively. Since stellar flares can have a duration of only a few minutes, we request that some of our observations will be configured in short cadence mode."

Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence. Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100 AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013).  In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star. In Deacon et al. (2016) we showed that wide binarity does not affect the occurrence rate of P<300 day planets around FGK stars. We plan to expand this to M dwarfs using K2 data. Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity. Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars. 

Science Goal 2: Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components. 

We have used the proper motion catalogue produced by Kraus et al. (2014) based on the methods of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007) including proper motions, estimated spectral types and distance moduli from SED fitting. We have selected objects with significant (>5 sigma) proper motions above 30 mas/yr. From these we selected pairs of widely separated objects with common proper motion and distance.  To remove contamination due to coincident pairings of unrelated field stars, we plotted a histogram of pair separations similar to the one we constructed for previous fields. From this we will select pairs which lie in the region dominated by true physical pairs. Field 11's low latitude means that the coincident pairing rate is too high to select any true common proper motion binaries, but field 12 and 13 are rich with identifiable wide binary systems."
GO12007,12,Steven,,Kawaler,Iowa State University,sdk@iastate.edu,,Search for rotational modulation in precise photometry of white dwarf stars,"This program will use very sensitive photometric observations of known white dwarfs by K2 during Campaigns 12, and 13 to search for rotational modulation of the flux from white dwarf stars.  These photometric variations can be caused by processes such as magnetic phenomena (such as starspots and plages) or large-scale granulation caused by convection. On the expected white dwarf rotation periods (about 1 day, generalizing from nonradially pulsating white dwarfs), the low amplitude of the expected variations renders them extremely difficult to detect using ground-based photometry. Measurement of rotation modulation (or even upper limits to photometric amplitude variations) will further exploit those data to teach us about magnetic fields and other processes in these stars that are otherwise inaccessible observationally.  

These new targets will build on results from observations in earlier K2 campaigns, allowing a statistically meaningful assessment of white dwarf rotation as an indicator of angular momentum transport during earlier phases of evolution.

In the nonradially pulsating white dwarfs, we can independently measure the rotation rate, providing a test of asteroseismic rotation periods."
GO12010,12,Aleks,,Scholz,University of St Andrews,as110@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Damasso, Mario; Peterson, Dawn E; Matt, Sean P; Stelzer, Beate","Rotation of M dwarfs: spindown, activity, and gyrochronology","Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter for the evolution of stars and planets. Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy.

Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012). For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission.

The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars.

Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem.

Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013).

Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. Several hundred of them (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields from 2014 to 2017. We have successfully applied for time in previous campaigns and the lightcurves for campaigns 0-5 are fully analysed, paper close to submission (Stelzer et al., A&A). For fields 11-13, observed in late 2016 and early 2017, we propose to include ~100 targets in the K2 fields for these campaigns for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them will fall onto the Kepler chips. For the subsequent fields we will submit similarly sized numbers of objects. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner using the procedures developed for previous campaigns."

This will be achieved using short-cadence (SC) data collected during K2 Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 (C11-13). The information contained in solar-like oscillations allows the internal stellar structure to be constrained to unprecedented levels, and allows precise determinations of fundamental stellar properties (e.g., mass, radius, and age). We seek to exploit the unique opportunity offered by K2 to observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed during the nominal mission, thus benefiting from better independent constraints (from, e.g., parallaxes, spectroscopy, interferometry, etc.). This will make it possible to bring the full potential of asteroseismology to bear to test the physics of stellar interiors. To constrain our analysis further we plan for a spectroscopic follow-up of the proposed targets. By combining the targets observed during C11-13 with those from previous K2 campaigns that possess independent constraints we may calibrate seismic scaling relations. This will be essential in seismic galactic archaeology studies, which rely on the application of these relations. Including also targets from the nominal mission, we may study the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood and place constraints on the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars. The results will be used in ongoing investigations that are relevant to this solicitation:
-In C13 we propose to observe several members of the Hyades open cluster, where we intend to obtain independent constraints from interferometry with CHARA, and for the brightest targets simultaneous RV observation with the SONG telescope network. We have successfully detected solar-like oscillations in two Hyades stars observed during C4; adding to this with targets from C13 with independent constraints will greatly help our ongoing analysis of the Hyades.
-The targets will further expand the sample of benchmark stars having precise fundamental properties from asteroseismology to different fields in the Galaxy, which will be crucial to calibrate upcoming large surveys such as Gaia and GALAH. The use of results from our asteroseismic analysis of targets from C1-3 have already been requested by the Gaia-ESO team to help calibrate their astrophysical parameters data reduction pipeline.
-The availability of precise asteroseismic ages of stars with detectable surface rotation periods will provide additional constraints for gyrochronology.
-Asteroseismology will allow us to better characterize targets with detected exoplanets, including both new detections made by K2 and known exoplanet-host stars on our list.

We estimate requesting for 40-50 targets per campaign. These should show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes, hence SC data are required for detecting the oscillations. We will prepare analysis-ready light curves from pixel-data using in-house software - these will be made available to the community via the KASOC portal. Next, we will apply well-tested analysis procedures to the frequency-power spectra of the light curves, providing both estimates of global seismic parameters and parameters describing individual modes of oscillation. Detailed frequency modelling using state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes will then provide the stellar properties. The methodology delineated above has already been successfully applied to the analysis of K2 C1-5 data, for which we reached a very good understanding of the asteroseismic detection yield. From C3-5 data we have found that solar-like oscillations can be detected for stars similar to the Sun, with characteristic frequencies around 3100 micro Hertz. We have also successfully extracted individual frequencies for these stars, hence enabling detailed seismic modelling."
GO12013,12,Gordon,T,Richards,Drexel University,gtr@physics.drexel.edu,"Kasliwal, Vishal Pramod; Vogeley, Michael S.",Variability of Luminous Quasars as a Function of Accretion Rate,"Active Galactic Nuclei are known to exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Variability in the optical is observed at the 10% level in 99% of quasars. The cause of quasar variability is not known, but current theories suggest that the variations may be attributable to a combination of small-scale variations in the accretion disk viscosity that are triggered by localized dynamo processes, accretion disk instabilities, large scale fueling-rate variations, and complex oscillations of the accretion disk. Optical variability may be driven by X-ray variability which itself may be generated by flares in the accretion disk. Physical mechanisms for variability introduce causal correlation into the light curves of quasars i.e. it may be possible to probe the physical drivers of quasar variability by studying the correlation structure of their light curves.

One of the challenges in understanding the physics of quasar variability is that, while one can compute an average quasar spectral energy distribution, there is no ""standard"" quasar.  The diversity of quasars is seen in their radio and X-ray continuum and UV emission lines and can be characterized by the mass-weighted accretion rate or Eddington ratio (L/LEdd).  Exploring quasar variability as a function of that diversity is the focus of this work.

We will explore the amplitude/timescale of short-time variability as determined by Kepler---as a function of those quasar properties that exhibit the largest dispersion (and thus represent quasar extrema). The goal being to try to understand if quasars at opposite extremes have different short time variability that is manifested in the Kepler data and can constrain quasar physics.  There are 1238 quasars in the Campaign 12 area for which such an investigation can be conducted.

We will further compare the amplitude/timescale of short-time variability as determined by Kepler to the long-time variability as determined by SDSS (and the combination of SDSS and Kepler).  Here we will compare the variability to the expected variability from a Damped Random Walk (which is the same at both short and long timescale) and to a CARMA model (which can be different at short and long timescales).  Again, the goal is to constrain quasar accretion physics.  There are 808 quasars in the Campaign 12 area that have existing SDSS time domain data for which such an investigation can be conducted.

Bright objects (i<~19.25, which amounts to about 12% of the samples) can be studied individually.  Fainter objects can contribute to this work through stacking analysis.  Specifically, we will group the quasars by like UV (also radio and X-ray) properties and treat the light curves from them as the light curve from a single mean source.

Without a better understanding of differences in quasar variability across the diversity of quasar emission line properties, we will not be able to fully understand the physics of quasar variability.  The combination of known SDSS quasars (many with existing time domain information) with new K2 data would be an incredibly powerful tool for AGN variability analysis.  While future K2 fields will also cover part of the SDSS footprint, this is the last field that is planned to overlap with the Stripe 82 region of SDSS where there exists time domain data. Thus this is rare opportunity that would be a shame to miss."
GO12014,12,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,"Rotation rates and ages of stars in wide binary systems, and a search for hierarchical triples in Kepler K2 campaigns 11-12-13","Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and presumably have very similar chemical compositions. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated, which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are. Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 11, 12, and 13, we have identified a total of 180 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 60. Our statistical analysis indicates that about 90% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignment of unrelated stars). Half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. A majority of the secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, many pairs can be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target (or may use fewer pixels overall). One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, which means that a significant fraction of wide binaries may actually be hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or eclipsing) binary star; this prediction will be directly tested with K2, by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries in those pairs."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is known about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. Our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed by K2 in campaigns 11, 12, and 13 identifies 2,604 high-velocity subdwarfs that are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, in order to identify and characterize the first generations of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will be complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."

Low-mass M dwarfs provide the highest probability of detecting small (<0.5  4 R_E) transiting
planets by virtue of the large transit depths seen for such small stars. These deep transits also
increase the potential for subsequent atmospheric characterization. The extended Kepler K2 mission
provides the opportunity to monitor tens-of-thousands of nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise,
long-cadence photometry and discover a new population of rocky and potentially habitable planets
and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit spectroscopy. We propose to observe several
thousand additional M dwarfs in the K2 campaigns 1113 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our
successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate dozens to
hundreds of small planets around late-type stars from the full K2-MDP program. This
new population of planets will drastically increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems,
improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and
atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected from the SUPERBLINK proper-motion database on the basis of
high proper-motion and photometric colors. This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs
within 100pc of the Sun from this deep (95% complete to V =19) catalog with little contamination.
Our targets have median brightness Kp<16, most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC.
We prioritize our targets using expected transit S/N, determined by comparing K2s photometric
precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting super-Earth. We estimate transit
depths by converting DSS, PanSTARRS 1, 2MASS, and WISE photometry to spectral type and
then to radius and temperature. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light
curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate
planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity,
and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring
for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host
characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf
planets to date. The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward these goals and
draws on considerable experience from Kepler. We have so far had successful target
proposals in all previous K2 fields, have been awarded large, multisemester programs
at ESO (for spectroscopic follow-up), Keck (for Radial Velocity masses), and Gemini
(for AO and speckle imaging).


Relevance

The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims
to exploit the strengths of the K2 mission design to reveal hundreds of small planets
around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-like planets and planets
suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky planets and key transit
spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) leading up
to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; well before the launch of TESS.

Our goals are to discover pulsating variable stars, as well as eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars with variability produced by rotating spots or flares, and develop statistics on the occurrence of variability.  This proposal complements observations taken for our previous K2 GO Cycle 1, 2, and 3 proposals, as each K2 field samples different stellar populations in the Galactic disk, halo, spiral arms, and young clusters near the ecliptic plane.  We use B-V and J-K colors and magnitudes in the EPIC catalog to select main-sequence stars with Kepler magnitudes between 6 and 16.  The Kepler signal-to-noise level is high enough to identify variability in even the faintest proposed targets, and many of these stars will be bright enough for ground-based follow-up observations, including high-resolution spectroscopic observations for pulsation mode identification.  The survey will also be useful to identify promising targets for current or future space-based observations by, e.g., TESS, PLATO, or BRITE.

Observations by the Kepler spacecraft have turned out to be ideal for discovery and characterization of main-sequence stars pulsating in radial and nonradial pressure and gravity modes. The long time series and high precision of the photometry have enabled determination of frequencies of modes with periods of order a day (g modes) to a few hours (p and mixed modes), and amplitudes as low as tens of parts per million using long-cadence data (30-min integrations per data point). Analysis of the Kepler data has raised a number of questions about the possible pulsation driving mechanisms for gamma Doradus g-mode and delta Scuti p-mode pulsations, and revealed an unexpectedly large number of hybrid star candidates that show pulsations in both types of modes. The Kepler data have also been used to study slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars (g-mode pulsators), beta Cephei stars (p-mode pulsators) and their hybrids to test stellar pulsation theory in the presumably simpler case for these hotter stars with smaller inefficient envelope convection zones. The analysis has also revealed a number of apparently non-pulsating stars that lie within the pulsation instability regions established by theory that need to be explained. We expect to increase the numbers of these types of stars available for detailed study, especially for candidates brighter than those found in the original Kepler field. We also expect to discover additional eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars. 

Our sample selection is not biased toward known pulsators, and includes enough stars to derive statistics on the occurrence of variability.  We will compare our results with similar surveys of stars in the original Kepler Cygnus-Lyra field as well as K2 Fields 6, 8, and 10, and with surveys of stars in open clusters for K2 Fields 0, 4, 5, and 7.  We will also extend the time series of observations for some Hyades cluster stars observed in the K2 Field 4 that are also observable in Field 13.  We will produce a catalog of the candidate variables, eclipsing binaries, and magnetically active stars that we find.

Although we are proposing to observe several thousand targets (large proposal), our budget request will be $50K (small-proposal limit) for the PI to oversee the project, prepare the catalog, and present results in journal papers and at conferences."

Carbon stars may be responsible for at least half the dust returned to the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) (e.g., Jura & Kleinmann 1989, Gehrz 1989). However, while progress has recently been made linking the dust production and mass loss of these stars to their long-term pulsations, little is known about their high-frequency oscillations. Most of the work so far has concentrated on the oxygen-rich sample of evolved stars (e.g., Banyai et al. 2013, 2014). To fill this void, we will use K2 to observe the evolved carbon stars in the next three campaigns. K2 enables us to to bypass a basic problem in Galactic astronomy: the unknown distances to Galactic carbon stars. With K2 data, the asteroseismologic techniques and models that have been developed for oxygen-rich stars (e.g., Chaplin & Miglio 2013) can be applied to the carbon stars in order to determine their fundamental parameters like mass, radius, and surface gravity - independent of their unknown distances. Thus, a small investment of K2 time, 29 long-cadence observations, has the potential for a very high
scientific payoff."

UCDs occupy the transition from main-sequence stars to brown dwarfs (late-M and later) and are essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the lowest mass objects in the Universe. Historically, photometric monitoring of UCDs for transiting planets and rotational spot modulation has been hampered by their intrinsic faintness and the expected short duration of transit events. The K2 spacecraft provides an excellent opportunity to study these objects in more detail, thanks to the large aperture and near-continuous 80-day photometric coverage of each K2 field. 

Searching for Transiting Planets Orbiting UCDs: The discovery of a transiting-planet orbiting a UCD would having significant implications for the field of exoplanets. UCDs are small, all roughly the diameter of Jupiter, which implies deep fractional transit signatures. UCDs are also relatively bright in the infrared. A planet that transits a UCD, whether gaseous or rocky, would be an ideal target for near-infrared transit transmission spectroscopy, as has been successfully performed on super Earths orbiting mid-M dwarf stars with the Hubble Space Telescope. Future transit transmission observations with NASAs James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets, but only for those planets that transit ultra-cool dwarfs. The transits from rocky planets orbiting mid-M dwarf stars and earlier are simply not deep enough to search for biosignatures over the expected lifetime of JWST. Recent studies of short-period planet occurrence around early and mid M dwarfs show that lower mass stars have significantly more rocky short-period planets than Sun-like stars. Extrapolating to ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect a large fraction, if not all UCDs to harbor rocky planets with transit probabilities of ~10%. 

Spot morphology at the M/L transition: Studies indicate that over 90% of UCDs show evidence of surface activity in the form of H± emission; however, the nature of the activity is not fully understood. Unlike sun-like stars, UCDs have fully convective interiors and are expected to have magnetic field morphologies markedly different from the Sun. With precise photometric monitoring of UCDs with K2 we will measure the morphology of spots on the surfaces of UCDs via light curve inversion. We will also search for flare events and correlate those flare events to specific spots structures. 

Surface activity in UCDs is related to stellar wind and ultraviolet emission from their chromospheres, both of which affect the photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets. Understanding the nature of surface activity on UCDs is therefore critical for interpreting transit-transmission spectroscopy, as well as inferring the habitability of any detected planets. K2 provides a unique opportunity to study ultra-cool dwarfs in a way never before realized."

A major result from surveys for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars.  This trend is not seen, however, around super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al 2014).  We propose to search a large sample of sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] < 0.0) stars in the fields of K2 GO Cycle 4 Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 for transiting planets of all sizes.  Stars in this metallicity range fall into three populations: a) the thin-disk (which also extends into super-solar metallicity), b) the thick-disk, and c) the halo (which extends to extremely metal poor stars). These three populations differ both kinematically and chemically.  Thick disk stars exhibit a larger vertical scale height in the galactic orbits, and they also show alpha-capture element abundances enhanced by about a factor of two over thin-disk stars.  Halo stars show even more extreme kinematics and also exhibit significant enhancement of alpha-capture elements.  The discovery of the Kepler-444 system (Campante et al 2015), which comprises five sub-Earth size planets orbiting an ancient (11.2 Gy age) thick-disk star with significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe=H]=-0.69 +/- 0.09 dex) shows that planet formation started very early in the history of the galaxy.  We will compute planet occurrence rates for stars as a function of stellar metallicity, stellar population and of planet radius.  For stellar metallicity, we will consider not just the standard [Fe/H] abundance, but also the abundance of the very important alpha-capture elements.  The goal of our program is to determine the characteristics of the first stars in our Galaxy to form potentially habitable planetary systems.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W.  Cochran), the European KEST consortium (represented in this proposal by Dr. M. Fridlund),  and at KASI (led by Dr.  B.-C. Lee) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.  and will perform Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.

Targets:
We will propose a large sample of approximately 3000 targets.  They range in V magnitude from about 5 to 13, with most of the targets in the range 10 < V < 12.  Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2015, MNRAS, 247, 2880) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 80 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems. These results will provide important new constraints on the physics and chemistry of planetary system formation, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."
GO12026,12,Elme,,Breedt,University of Warwick,E.Breedt@warwick.ac.uk,,Accretion disc variability in Cataclysmic Variables,"Accretion discs are a common occurrence in the universe. They exist on physical scales spanning orders of magnitude, ranging from the parsec scale discs which power active galactic nuclei to protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (few thousand km). The flow of material and angular momentum through these discs are governed by the same underlying physical processes, but timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion discs around cataclysmic variables (CVs) are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure and the effects of accretion rate variations, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Continuing our programme from campaigns 0 to 10, we propose to monitor the CVs and X-ray binaries in the K2 fields with the aim of building a library of high quality light curves that can be used to investigate disc-based phenomena. CVs and other accreting compact objects display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days). The unique capability of Kepler/K2 to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is key to understand accretion and accretion variability over such a wide range of timescales."

The small size of a white dwarf (WD) star (approx. 1 Earth radii) implies that any sub-stellar or gas giant companion at suitable orbital inclination will completely eclipse it, while terrestrial bodies smaller than the Moon, including asteroids, will still produce transits that are detectable in high signal/noise light-curves.

Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approx. 25% at circa 1Gyr, Zuckerman et al.2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.

The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically significant (500 to 1000) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a significant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).

A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al.(2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al.(2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD?

This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery. 

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm(5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 1, 222  and 22 WDs (campaigns 11, 12 and 13), that have been spectroscopically identified or are deemed to have a 90% or greater probability of being a WD (Fusillo et al. 2015), and which are brighter than Kepler Magnitude 19.5 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues."

The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars need to be rotating slower than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 210 days. 

The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that many, but by no means all, Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars. 

Currently there are only three A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-57b). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars. 

Using Kepler and K2, we have a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to: 
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binarity within the Am stars, 
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars. 

Only 15 Am stars were observed during the Kepler mission, with a further 83 observed during earlier K2 Campaigns. For this proposal we have 52 targets for Campaigns 11 to 13. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to 150. 

The proposal team are experienced in the reduction of Kepler data using PyKE tools and in the analysis of time-varying photometry. We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary. 

The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."
GO12029,12,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,bod21@cam.ac.uk,,Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types cooler than M5, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such an exoplanet has not been discovered yet. As of today, K2 is the only facility that provides the required stability and photometric precision to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0 through 10 observations.

SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.

High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).

RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.

METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 11, 12 and 13, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series. The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on existing K2 data and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program.

EXPECTED YIELD. Our target list encompasses 84 M6-L6 targets. We statistically expect to detect 1 to 2 planets in this specific sample.

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."

Galaxy. The tidal disruption of a close binary by the supermassive black
hole (SMBH) in the Galactic center was suggested as their origin. Most
of the known HVSs are of late B spectral type. Therefore, their
evolutionary state is still ambigious - either they are distant, massive
(2-4 solar masses) main sequence stars or closer, low mass blue
horizontal branch stars.
To achieve the full 6D phase space information their distances need to
be known accurately. With Kepler light curves it will be possible to
detect the low amplitude, slow variability indicative of a slowly
pulsating main sequence star.
In addition, inconsistencies between time of flight and evolutionary
lifetime occured, which call for ejection scenarios involving triple
systems and mergers. Such a triple could be ejected as a HVS binary
through interactions with the SMBH in the Galactic Center. The discovery
of such a binary could explain the appearence of young stars in the
distant Galactic halo by rejuvenation through merging. But much more
close HVS binaries are predicted to exist than mergers. The K2 mission

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes and photometry, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? In order to answer this question, we need to understand their multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates.  

The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above. Because of the limited precision on the ground based observations to measure rotation periods, we propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates. In K2 fields 11, 12 and 13, we will observe ten nearby systems, including three K and seven M dwarfs. One of the systems, GJ0176, has a known planet and the other, GJ1286, is the closest star among all three campaigns.

This is principally a consequence of their intrinsic faintness for the majority of their orbits, and the acute difficulty in securing long baseline and consistently accurate observations on the largest of ground based optical/IR telescopes to sufficiently sample ~ 4 to 40 hour periods (the approximate range of the currently known sample for which rotational data exists). The K2 mission however offers an ideal platform to study any sufficiently bright short period comets that serendipitously pass through each of the planned Cycle 4 Campaign fields - K2's unparalleled photometric sensitivity combined with its ~ 70 day observational baseline represents a unique observational opportunity to study these mysterious and compelling objects. Using both the K2ephem tool and JPL's HORIZON facility, we identified 15 short period comets that pass within the campaign fields with predicted magnitudes < 22 - 13 are Jupiter Family Comets (JFC), one is a Main Belt Comet (MBC) and one is a Centaur. Of the 11 located > 3 AU (including the MBC/`active asteroid' 176P/LINEAR), K2's  precision photometry will allow us to accurately characterize their nucleus rotation periods. For the remaining 4 comets within 3 AU that are expected to be active, full coverage of their passage across K2's field of view will yield a unique temporal profile of nucleus activity, in addition to a rotational period. These data will be immediately pertinent to our understanding of cometary nucleus density and structure (of great relevance in the assessment of viable NEO mitigation strategies), the relationship between rotation & activity, links between JFCs and Kuiper Belt Objects and their formation, and complement extensive campaigns to date to study size, albedo and color properties.

We will use the data to test models of thermal activity for both objects, models of jets and/or rings for Chiron, and models of impacts and devolatilization for 176P. Lightcurves obtained from the ground lack the sensitivity and continuous time coverage needed to test these models. Knowledge gained about distantly active comet nuclei are important to test models of how icy bodies sublimate and outgas, which has implications for NASA missions to outer solar system icy bodies.

Chiron is an unusual icy minor planet.  First identified as an asteroid,  its sporadic coma warranted a comet designation, and its orbit identifies it as a Centaur. Its brightness varies significantly on short and long timescales and a H2O-ice signature was detected, which also varies. The changes do not correlate well with heliocentric distance, and until recently were largely unexplained, other than those due to nucleus rotation of ~5.9 hours. Recently, strong evidence for a ring system or jets was discovered, which may account for the rest of the brightness variations. Rings may also explain the changes in the H2O-ice spectra, if the changes are due to changes in the aspect angle of Chiron, giving us a different view of the rings over time. The evidence is strong for rings; however, they are not confirmed. Also, rings would not explain the occasional outbursts and coma, which occur too far from the Sun to be caused by H2O ice sublimation, the driver of normal comets. Lightcurve data from K2 would help differentiate between models of jets and rings.

Main belt asteroid 118401 exhibited cometary activity in 2005 and was given the comet designation 176P.  Spectral analysis shows that 176P is of a different nature and origin than the rest of Kuiper belt or Oort Cloud comets. It has a ~5 year orbital period, and despite an extensive ground-based campaign, no coma was observed during the last perihelion, bringing up the possibility that the object is devolatilized.  Spectral analysis of 176P shows that this comet is of a different nature and origin than the rest of Kuiper belt or Oort Cloud comets and has a rotation period of 22.23 hour with substantial lightcurve variations of 0.7 magnitude, which may indicate a highly elongated shape. This object may belong to a third reservoir of comets (after Oort cloud and Kuiper belt), which could be an important source for Earths oceans.  During Campaign 12, 176P will be approaching perihelion on 2017 Mar 12. Thus, Campaign 12 is a great opportunity to observe any possible activity associated with its closest approach to the Sun. 

Observing both objects for ~80 days will significantly reduce uncertainties about their nature. We propose to use K2 to measure the lightcurves of Chiron and 176P to test the proposed ring and jet models for Chiron, measure the rotational period of 176P and document any activity from both. Ultimately, this project will contribute to our understanding of how icy bodies in our solar system become active at large heliocentric distances."

Widely used in the asteroseismology of red giants, asteroseismic scaling relations connect stellar properties such as masses and radii to easy-to-derive seismic parameters such as the frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation. Although scaling relations do have some theoretical justification, they are still mostly based on the only star whose parameters we truly know: the Sun. The precise seismic K2 observations coupled with high-quality ground-based interferometric and spectroscopic data of bright nearby giants will allow us to subject the scaling relations to the most demanding tests. 
The second application is to constrain the poorly understood mixing processes working inside red giants, such as thermohaline mixing, rotation, and deep circulation. These processes are predicted to have different impact at different stages of red giant evolution, and to leave imprints in the surface chemical composition of a star. Precise seismic log (g) from K2 time series, coupled with high resolution spectroscopy, will allow for a detailed abundance determination of a large number of chemical species.  The correlations between elements (e.g. [C/ Fe] vs [N/ Fe]) and departure from their theoretically predicted values (as in the case of Li or 12 C/13 C) are tracers of internal mixing processes, and will be studied as a function of the seismically determined mass.
The third goal of this proposal is to address one of the biggest uncertainties in stellar astrophysics: the abundance of helium in stars. The helium second ionization zone inside a star produces an abrupt change in the local sound speed, which is detectable in the Fourier spectrum of time series as a periodic variation. We will construct detailed models of red giants where this variation is detected, and coupled with independent constraints on angular diameter and detailed surface composition, we will put stringent constraints on the helium abundance of red giants and test our assumptions on enrichment laws of the Galaxy.
We have selected ~30 bright (Kp<8) red giants which are ideally suited for this project due to their precisely determined distances, large angular sizes for interferometry, and detectable oscillations in the 80 day K2 baseline. Red giants observed by Kepler were generally too faint to meet these criteria, making K2 uniquely suited to perform these observations. Our proposal addresses compelling questions in stellar structure and evolution, and is hence directly related to the K2 GO solicitation."

For these binary stars, we find a striking deficiency of small planets. We propose to observe more known binary stars to confirm the deficiency. We consider only S-type circumstellar planet system, in which a planet orbits one of the binary stars, NOT circumbinary planets (P-type).

Our sample consists of 1208 binary stars, which represents the largest sample of binary stars for planet search. This sample will allow us to study small and large planets in binary stars. The former can be uniquely probed by the K2 mission. We will reduce the measurement uncertainty by a factor of 2-3, which will place better constraints on the occurrence rate of planets in binary stars

Targeting binary stars with no prior information of planet helps to unambiguously address the planet occurrence rate in binary stars. Increasing the sample size helps not only to confirm the deficiency of planets in binary stars but also study the influence of stellar companions on planets with different sizes and orbital separations. Future NASA mission in search of habitable worlds will inevitably encounter with this question: to select binary stars or not, which account for 33% of stars in the solar neighborhood. This proposal will pave the way to solve this question."

Indeed, K2 observed the first such example in Campaign 1: WD1145+017 (Vanderburg et al. 2015).  Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013). The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations. The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]).  Given the extreme difficulty of measuring atmospheric properties of Earth-sized planets around solar-like stars, our first biomarker characterization of an Earth-sized planetary atmosphere, may come from an object transiting a white dwarf star. Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015). I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours. 

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns).

Methodology: Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total. The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits. The first planets detected were around a compact object, a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992).  Additionally, N-body simulations of planetary systems through stellar evolution indicate it is possible to return significant mass objects back very close to the white dwarf (Veras & Gaensicke 2015), so it is likely for white dwarfs to host planets. Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign. Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence. Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground. While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation. However, a followup campaign on known targets is quite straightforward. At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope. However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."

By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiant stars in this mass range [1], but the masses of these subgiants have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus ~60 planet candidates that are awaiting validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement subgiant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets, and close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the subgiants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars. There are currently only ~10 such confirmed planets; this population is currently almost totally unexplored. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2.

Targets: We plan to request approximately 400 long cadence targets, ~3/4 of which will be in Field 11. The sample will consist of A and early F-type dwarfs with 8<V<12.5, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: Our colleagues at the DLR and University of Cologne (Germany) will prepare lightcurves and search for transit signals. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory and the forthcoming NRES spectrographs on the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT); we will leverage our group's experience with similar observations of Kepler prime mission targets. For long-period targets where the K2 observations are insufficient to constrain the transit emphemeris, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with LCOGT. Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other techniques. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (which uses the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect on rapidly rotating stars, where the spectral line distortion during transit is spectroscopically resolved) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit. This will continue our program to validate Kepler prime mission candidates using Doppler tomography [5]; we will use the same methodology for K2 candidates.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets. It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come. I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 pc.  A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons. This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes. This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques.  Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars.  While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges. A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be 200-300 stars (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars). In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored. The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets.

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability. An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003). One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium. This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint. Long cadence observations would be appropriate.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found. These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."

E.; Raddi, Roberto; Bell, Keaton","K2 Observations of Variable White Dwarfs in Fields 11, 12 and 13","We propose observations of variable white dwarfs (WDs) in Fields 11-13 of the K2 mission. We propose short-cadence observations of known and high-probability pulsating WDs. We additionally propose short-cadence observations of known magnetic and metal-polluted white dwarfs to constrain magnetic activity in these stars, and to search for possible transits in around stars with known evolved planetary systems.

As they cool, WDs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres pulsate as DAVs (a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) when they reach the appropriate effective temperature to foster a hydrogen partial-ionization zone, which efficiently drives global oscillations. This range of temperatures empirically spans roughly 12,600-11,100 K for typical-mass (0.6 Msun) WDs. Pulsating WDs provide an important glimpse into the interior of the future of the vast majority (> 97%) of all stars in our Galaxy, including our Sun, allowing us to probe the masses and compositions of their electron-degenerate cores, as well as of their non-degenerate envelopes; to determine their internal rotation profiles; and to detect weak magnetic fields.

Since the DAV instability strip is defined by temperature, color selection is an excellent predictor of variability. Our team discovered all DAVs in the original Kepler mission, which is leading to exquisite insight into white dwarf interiors. We have applied the same photometric selection methods to K2 Fields 11-13 using the SDSS, VST/ATLAS, and VPHAS+ multiwavelength surveys, and have identified 75 excellent candidate white dwarfs on silicon in the three fields with colors consistent with the empirical DAV and DBV instability strips. Additionally, there are three previously published pulsating white dwarfs in Field 12. We have used ground-based resources to refine the atmospheric parameters of many of these candidates, confirming than a large number fall within the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. Additionally, we have confirmed pulsations in two new white dwarfs using ground-based high-speed photometry. With typical pulsations ranging from 100-1400 s, we require short-cadence observations of these white dwarfs.

Every new DAV we can observe with K2 adds significant legacy value, since it brings us that much closer to statistically significant studies of white dwarfs with ensemble asteroseismology. There were only six pulsating white dwarfs in the original Kepler mission, but that number has grown to at least 20 with K2, and will continue to grow as the extended mission progresses.

Additionally, we propose long-cadence observations of all other WD candidates in these fields, to continue our in-depth study into rotation, magnetic activity, planetary systems, and binarity in the endpoints of stellar evolution. These observations simultaneously allow for serendipitous discoveries, including possible eclipses or transits, as demonstrated by the unique disintegrating planetesimal orbiting a WD in K2 Campaign 1 (Vanderburg et al. 2015, Nature, 526, 546)."

Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission.

SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct an intensive monitoring of TRAPPIST-1, a nearby ultracool dwarf star around which 3 Earth-size planets have just been detected (Gillon+, Nature, in press). The main aims of this programme are to constrain the masses of these planets and to search for additional companions in the system.

SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to measure precise transit timings for the three planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1. We expect minimum transit timing variations (TTV) of the order of 40s for the two inner planets. We require short-cadence observations as to precisely constrain the ingress and egress times, which will provide significantly enhanced accuracy on the transit timings, compared to long-cadence observations. None of these planets will have their masses measured by radial velocities anytime soon, because of the small expected amplitudes (3-5 m/s) and faintness of the host star (Kp=16.9) for RV facilities. TTV therefore represent the only avenue to constrain these planets masses and densities. The secondary goal of our programme is to undertake an unprecedented search for additional bodies in this system, including planets and trojans.

METHODOLOGY. We perform detailed n-body simulations of the 3-planet system TRAPPIST-1. Assuming different planetary masses (pure iron to pure ice), we estimate the amplitude of transit timings variations (TTV) on a 80-day timeframe, corresponding to the length of a K2 campaign. We find amplitudes of about 40s in the conservative case of circular orbits. A modest eccentricity on the c planet (e=0.05) would increase by a factor 3 the TTV amplitudes. Given the target Kp=16.9, we estimate that our proposed programme will yield 1.5 to 6 sigma precision on the planet masses, provided our target is observed in short-cadence mode. Our code is built to invert the TTV problem, ie use a set of transit timings and orbital parameters to derive the planetary masses/eccentricities in a MCMC framework.

RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal will dramatically improve our knowledge of the only known exoplanetary system for which atmospheric absorption features in temperate Earth-size exoplanets could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASAs Origins Program, namely the 1) characterisation of exoplanets, 2) study of planetary formation and 3) the search for cosmic life."

So far, stars brighter than Kp < 6 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 long-cadence observations of the brightest K2 stars in campaigns 11-13 (including 36 Oph, the brightest K dwarf observable by K2) using a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels. Asteroseismic studies of these targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants and insights into poorly understood internal processes of intermediate-mass stars such as convective core overshooting.

We selected 54 targets with Kp < 6.0 mag from the Hipparcos catalog. We will use small (~20x20 pixel) circular apertures around the saturated core for each target, and perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method (so-called halo photometry) has been demonstrated to detect pulsations for all bright Pleiades and Hyades stars observed in Campaign 4. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Our proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics, a key science goal of the K2 mission. Our project furthermore supports galactic astrophysics, another key science area identified in the NRA, through the calibration of scaling relations for galactic archeology studies. A better understanding of stellar models through the study of bright stars is relevant for science goals pursued by both present and future NASA missions such as the characterization of exoplanets (TESS, JWST) as well as stellar populations and galaxy formation/evolution (HST, JWST)."

An initial analysis of LLRGB stars observed for our C4-C5 program has already yielded the discovery of the first potentially re-inflated warm Jupiter around an oscillating evolved star, and we propose to continue our survey by observing ~5400 targets in C11-C13 to build up a statistically significant planet sample. 

We have selected targets using spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, RAVE and LAMOST, as well as colors and reduced proper motions. Planet candidates will be detected with K2 long-cadence data using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since LLRGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planets.

The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing LLRGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

We propose to survey all GKM dwarf stars within 1.0 degree of the ecliptic using the K2 spacecraft in order to identify transiting planetary systems that can mutually discover Earth via transit observations performed by another civilization in the last ~100,000 yrs.  This survey will significantly expand the number of ecliptic aligned planets known from the two Jupiter-class planets with 0.26 degrees of the current ecliptic (the hot-Jupiter, WASP-47b and the direct imaging, 5 Myr old 1RXS-J160929b) into the regime of Super-Earth size planets.

Methodology:
We will employ our extensive background in the analysis of Kepler data in order to search and provide a catalog of planet candidates from the K2 data within the ecliptic using tools and techniques developed for Kepler.  The primary goal is to generate a catalog of planet candidates for prioritization of SETI searches.  Secondary goals are to provide a well vetted sample of planet candidates to the community to follow up for asteroseismic or spectroscopic stellar characterization and radial velocity confirmation.   Future follow up with SETI resources of KEES planet candidates will provide the first constraints on the fraction of stars hosting at least one inner planet, that can discover Earth transit, and that contain intelligent life detectable to the SETI detection limits.

Relevance:
This study is proposing science targets for the K2 Campaign 11, 12, and 13 fields.  Detection and characterization for transiting planets on the ecliptic cannot be accomplished with existing Kepler data as Kepler did not observe the ecliptic.  More than 1000 targets targets will be proposed placing this proposal in the large proposal category."
GO12051,12,Erin,Lee,Ryan,Goddard Space Flight Center,erinleeryan@gmail.com,"Woodward, Charles E.",Lightcurves of Trojan and Hilda asteroids: Insight into Planetary Migration in the Early Solar System,"Studies of the small bodies of the solar system reveal important clues about the condensation and formation of planetesimal bodies, and ultimately planets in planetary systems. Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system, colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk, & studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength limiting models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies. 

Lightcurves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations and their origins. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. These 2 populations are in resonances with Jupiter & collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations. Results from the WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojans & ~40% of Hildas are either extremely elongated objects or binaries. Kepler optical light curves are required to confirm these controversial findings. Ground based surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability study due to large amounts of observing time required & nightly aliasing effects on lightcurves. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform and the correspondence between the C11 field and the L4 Trojan cloud. 


Methodology: We have identified 100 objects for study in the Hilda and Trojan asteroids to be studied with Kepler in C11-13 with magnitudes of m_V < 20. Due to the overlap between the Campaign 11 field and the L4 Trojan cloud, our request for data represents 70 objects Campaign 11, 23 objects in Campaign 12 & 7 objects in Campaign 13. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 24 days. Due to the motion of these targets, the Kepler Science Center assesses solar system program as containing more targets than proposed number of objects, (In C8, 6 Hilda targets are assessed as 4847 targets by the Kepler Science Center), thus THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity.

Relevance to K2:
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 11-13  to determine if these objects originated in the Kuiper Belt and later migrated and are amenable to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission and defined observing fields."
GO12052,12,Billy,L,Quarles,SETI Institute,billylquarles@gmail.com,"Rowe, Jason Frank; Antoci, Victoria",The heat is on: exoplanets that orbit hot stars,"Science Goals Objectives: The Kepler Mission has discovered a few thousand planet candidates, which has allowed for a statistical determination of planet size and orbital characterization.   In particular, multi-planet systems, where more than one planet is seen transiting a star have provided a wealth of information covering statistical confirmations, eccentricity distributions, mutual inclinations and dynamical stability.  We have learned that not only are planets plentiful, but are found in relatively flat and circular orbits.  However, this knowledge of the architecture exoplanetary systems is only currently valid for cooler G, K and M-dwarf stars, which were the prime targets from the original Kepler Mission.  From the Kepler Q1-Q17 catalogue there are only 254 planet-candidate systems where the host star has an effective temperature greater than 6500 K.  In stars with temperatures hotter than ~6500 K the stellar envelope structure and evolution on the main sequence is dominated by radiative transfer, opposed to cooler stars where convection plays an important role.   Misalignments between the planets orbital plane and stellar spin axis have been predominately found for stars with radiative atmospheres, whereas stars with convective envelopes typically show close alignment.  This observation is likely linked to the coupling of convective atmospheres and tidal forces.  As such, we wish to continue making observations with K2 to determine the occurrence rate and orbital properties of multi-planet systems around hot stars.

Methodology: The Kepler Mission was a planet finding machine!  Our team has extensive knowledge and experience with Kepler photometric data for both transit finding and analysis as well as performing asteroseismic analysis of stars with temperatures greater than 6500 K.  We have 236 targets selected for observation in C8 and will investigate a much larger list of target stars over C11, C12, and C13.  One of the problems of searching for planets around hotter stars is that many are known to pulsate (e.g. dSct and gDor type).  Fortunately, the pulsations can be identified and accounted for from photometric light curves to allow searches for planets to reach low-noise levels.  Our plan is to use detrended photometric data and apply asteroseismic tools to remove stellar phenomena that may affect the data and to then search for transiting planets.  We will then study the properties of the planet-candidates using transit-depths, transit-durations and impact parameter to estimate the distributions of orbital properties.  We will also estimate our planet search completeness and compare our measured properties to the properties of planetary systems found around cooler stars.

Relevance to Kepler-GO Program: Using space-based astronomical observations of star fields with K2, we will search for and characterize new planets around hot stars. Our research has the potential to determine whether the properties of the host star, convective or radiative atmospheres, play a role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.  Our proposed investigation is part of a multiple observing campaign search for which we have 236 stars selected for observation in a previous proposal.  Through our continued search of stars on the ecliptic, we will collect observations to make sure we find ample planetary systems around hot-stars to meet our research goals."

Thanks to its fast photometric cadence, continuous monitoring and high photometric accuracy, Kepler has provided unprecedented insights into various types of compact binaries, and holds an enormous potential for other astrophysical domains on top of planet hunting. Some of the most notable studies have revealed i) the mass ratio and precise orbital parameters through Doppler beaming and Romer delays for compact binaries (Bloemen et al. 2011, MNRAS,410, 178, Bloemen et al. 2012, MNRAS, 422, 2600), ii) the discovery of the rms-flux relation in the aperiodic flickering of accreting white dwarfs (WD, Scaringi et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 2854) iii) stringent tests to the disk instability model through the precise characterization of dwarf nova (DN) outburst cycles and (Cannizzo et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 117) iv) the discovery of a universal scaling relation linking the timing properties of Active Galactic Nuclei, accreting stellar-mass black holes, accreting white dwarfs and young-stellar objects (Scaringi et al. 2015, Sci. Adv, e1500686).

Here we propose to continue exploiting the capabilities of Kepler/K2, and specifically ask to observe 13 targets (6 SC and 7 LC) in Campaign 11, 3 (1 SC and 2 LC) in Campaign 12 and 2 (1 SC and 1 LC) in Campaign 13. Most targets have been selected from the Ritter & Kolb catalogue (A&A, 404, 301). Campaign 11 is particularly interesting given its close proximity to the Galactic centre, providing the opportunity to observe various X-ray binaries, including accreting stellar-mass black holes for the first time with Kepler. Because of this, additional targets are included in our target list as known X-ray binaries in Campaign 11. The precise target list will be defined on submission of the Step 2 proposal.

For all targets in our sample we will probe their broad-band variability properties. Together with similar targets observed during the previous K2 campaigns, this will form the most comprehensive study of optical aperiodic variability in accreting compact objects. Additionally for some systems we will also study the periodic emission (see e.g. Sco X-1 from Campaign 2, Scaringi et al. 2015, MNRAS, 451, 3857). With K2 we will be able to precisely fold the optical lightcurves on the orbital period of the systems. This in turn will allow us to isolate and study the different emission components arising form the secondary star, accretion disk and boundary layer/corona of the accreting objects themselves as a function of orbital phase."
GO12057,12,Csaba,,Kiss,Konkoly Observatory,pkisscs@konkoly.hu,"Pal, Andras; Mueller, Thomas G; Molnar, Laszlo; Kiss, Laszlo",Rotational properties of the active Centaur (2060) Chiron,"Scientific justification:

(2060) Chiron is a large Centaur, the first minor planet discovered in the outer Solar System, beyond Jupiter, in 1977. Chiron is also known as a comet (95P/Chiron) as it showed cometary activity when it was close to perihelion on its ~51-year-long orbit in the early 1990's. Stellar occultation data obtained in 2011 indicated the presence of extended features around Chiron. These were interpreted as jets (Ruprecht et al., 2015), but also as a possible ring system (Ortiz et al., 2014), similar to that observed around Chariklo (Braga-Ribas et al., 2014). A good quality light curve with a high accuracy rotational period of 5.917813 h was obtained based on data from 1987 and 1991 (Marcialis & Buratti, 1993). A very similar period was found by Luu & Jewitt (1990). Fornasier et al. (2013) found a somewhat shorter rotation period of ~5.4h, but this was obtained by a sparse sampling of the light curve. Recent observations concentrated on single photometric and spectroscopic measurements, but no detailed light curve data has been published since 1993. Chirons lightcurve amplitude seems to correlate with its activity level. According to Luu & Jewitt (1990), the light curve amplitude is larger (dm = 0.09 mag) when no activity is seen, and it is small (dm = 0.03 mag) when Chiron's coma is in its brightest phase -- this may be explained by the dilution of the lightcurve by an optically thin coma and/or a ring system (the latest, December 2011 observations showed an intermediate amplitude of dm=0.060.07). 

The Herschel Space Observatory observed Chiron in several bands from 70 to 500 um (Fornasier et al., 2013) in the ""TNOs are Cool!"" open time key program, resulting in the most reliable estimate of Chiron's size, ~210km diameter. A so far unpublished ""Must Do"" light curve observation was also performed with the PACS camera of Herschel at 70 and 160um, covering ~6.7h, longer than a full rotation period.    

Here we propose to observe Chiron in Campaign 12 of the K2 mission. Campaign 12 offers the possibility to obtain a 79 day-long, uninterrupted photometry and a high quality light curve, not measured in the last ~20 years. We will see Chiron at a larger distance from the Sun and under a very different aspect angle than in 1990. With these observations we will be able to characterise Chiron itself, since no activity is expected at this heliocentric distance. We can also determine the orientation of its spin axis by the comparison of the light curves, as it was recently done e.g. for the Neptune moon Nereid, based on K2 data (Kiss et al., 2016). The new light curve and the constrained spin axis orientation will also be important in the interpretation of the extended emission observed earlier. The K2 light curve data will be combined with the ""Must Do"" thermal light curve observed by Herschel and provide a detailed description of the shape and thermal properties of the surface. There are very few objects in the outer Solar System that have such a complete dataset, therefore Chiron is a unique target for a benchmark study that will significantly improve our knowledge of the intermediate-sized icy bodies beyond Jupiter.

Technical realisation: 

We propose to observe Chiron during the entire length of Campaign 12 in long cadence mode. In addition, we also propose to define a short cadence pixel mask around Chiron's stationary point to cover a 20-day period around January 26, 2017. The latter would provide us with an unprecedented, high-resolution light curve with moderate pixel budget requirements.

Two complementary approaches have been adopted, the first centered on in-depth studies of the Sun itself, and the second focusing on the study of solar analogs, stars which are like the Sun and thus might shed light on characteristics of its composition, structure, activity, planetary system, evolution, and future. The utility of the study of solar analogs is broad, ranging from finding night-time proxies for the Sun for calibration purposes to their use as snapshots of the evolutionary history of the Sun. Their study has helped to establish that chromospheric activity is key to understanding stellar rotation, activity, and dynamos. The project proposed here is aimed at providing a large consistent set of well-vetted solar analogs in order to address these questions. We will make use of the K2 mission fields to obtain precise photometric time series of approximately 1000 solar analogs, supplemented by asteroseismology and ground- and space-based spectroscopic data for the brighter and more promising candidates. From this data we will derive rotation periods, spot coverages, and flare rates for a well-calibrated sample of solar analogs. This work expands on the PIs ongoing Kepler and K2 analysis, and supports an ongoing project under NASA's Living With a Star program; the use of new fields will also allow us to compare different stellar populations and provide a growing sample of test data for the study of stellar activity, rotation, and dynamos.

The chosen targets will be selected on the basis of existing ground-based photometry supplemented by spectroscopy when available and guided by previous results and population models using TRILEGAL. We anticipate that <10% of the stars in our sample will be giants, but we can make use of light curves and power spectra to eliminate giants from our sample after the fact based on granulation noise (Mathur et al. 2011, Bastien et al. 2013, 2015). We will reduce our limiting magnitude from the ~14 we used for Kepler to ~12.5 to roughly compensate for the increased noise in K2 compared to Kepler, and make ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up easier. In addition,  our brightest candidates should be amenable to asteroseismology."

We propose to monitor a set of CVs in the K2 fields of Campaigns 11, 12 and 13. The Cycle 4 fields represent the extremes of stellar densities with the directions toward the pole and Galactic center. We have matched the K2 fields with several CV databases and a total of 17 targets are requested in this cycle.

Monitoring of these galaxies will allow us to look for fast to look for fast (t > 10 day) and faint (M < -14) stellar transients. The K2 science mission with its long baseline, high-cadence, power to obtain high precision photometry, and the ability to monitor several targets simultaneously provides a unique opportunity to examine such a broad range of variables and transients. 

The fast transients we wish to examine are defined by their fainter than SNe (Mv < -16) magnitudes, fast rise times and/or short lifetime. Perets et al. 2010 found a new class of faint events that were spectroscopically similar to SN Ib/c but had strong calcium lines in their nebular spectra. These objects characterized by a relatively fast light curve (12 - 15 days), making them difficult to find by traditional surveys, and thus the progenitors of these interesting events are unknown 

In addition, Drout et al. (2014), using the Pan-STARRS1 survey, found a few transients that were relatively bright (-16 < M < -20) but with a time near maximum of only a few days. Even though they are bright, their short time scale, some brightening in only a day, means these events are usually missed. The stellar origin of these events is also unknown. PTF has been a prolific discoverer of unique short-lived and/or faint events as well. 

This program will also be sensitive to LBV- and nova-like eruptions, large amplitude flare stars, cataclysmic variable stars, and other still unknown types of faint, fast transients. 

We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe these galaxies every other day using SkyMapper and ATLAS Pathfinder. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify the transients using PESSTO, and existing programs at Siding Spring, Lick, Gemini, and Keck."

They are crucial objects for understanding the structure and evolution of stars, and to explore connections between pulsation, mass loss, convection and rotation. Moreover, they are key tools in galactic and extragalactic studies as distance indicators. Still, only a few members of this group have been observed by space missions before K2. We are currently building up the most comprehensive sample of Cepheid light curves with the K2 mission and the upcoming field of views contain many important targets in various directions of the Galaxy. 

Space-based, continuous photometry revealed many puzzling phenomena in these stars. The lone Kepler Cepheid, V1154 Cyg exhibit small-scale irregularities (period jitter) and low-level modulation. Ground-based surveys indicate that first overtone stars are expected to have various low-amplitude additional modes. Hydrodynamical calculations suggest that various dynamical effects and even chaos can occur in the pulsation of type II Cepheids. These effects hold clues to various physical insights, but their observations require high-precision, continuous photometry that only K2 can provide. 

The three campaigns focus on very different Galactic directions:

The bulge
In Field 11 we identified ~150 targets, most of which are type II Cepheids. 124 candidates were collected from the still unpublished data of the OGLE IV survey. The high-priority targets include rare double- and triple-mode Cepheids, such as V767 Sgr, among others. 15 targets that we also included in our C9 DDT proposal fall into the overlapping region between Campaigns 9 and 11. Given the long pulsation periods of Cepheids, extended observations are highly desired. In addition, two Cepheids are members of globular clusters M9 and NGC 6316.  

The halo
The direction of Field 12 is not favorable for these stars, but we found 6 targets, of which 3 appear to be anomalous Cepheids. Many aspects of these stars are not well understood, including their formation. 

The outer Milky Way
In Field 13, towards the anti-center we found 10 targets. The priority target in this campaign is the well-known Cepheid SZ Tau that was already observed by MOST and it is accessible for the BRITE space telescopes as well. The star pulsates in the first overtone, so additional modes and/or dynamical effects are expected. The short MOST data already suggested the presence of some cycle-to-cycle variations. The observations would provide direct comparison of the capabilities of various space missions and form a multi-year data set for this star. 
 
Technical details
The KASC Working Group 7 has been involved in the Kepler mission from the start and has all the necessary skills to reduce the target pixel files and analyze the data, including the handling of crowded fields. We propose all stars to be observed in long cadence mode. Two stars, BF Oph and SZ Tau are very bright (6.9 and 6.4 mag, respectively) and can likely be recovered from the smear data. However, we request to assign a dedicated pixel mask to SZ Tau, given the importance and unique possibilities this star offers for us. We also note that BF Oph and SZ Tau are bright enough to be included in the Tycho-Gaia Asterometric Solution, expected to be released in 2016."

We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2, conducting reconnaissance spectroscopy, and ultimately gathering high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models. 

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small. 

We propose a ranked list of 13,356 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We generated this list by first searching for all moderately bright stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 11, 12, and 13, and then using the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. We also propose one short-cadence target: HIP116454, the first exoplanet system discovered from K2, which our team published last year.

We will identify planet candidates using the planet detection pipeline developed by our team members. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities. 

The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 80 nights per year of guaranteed time per year. The follow-up of small planets from Kepler and K2 is the top scientific priority of HARPS-N. 

We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. Our team has already delivered such products for previous K2 campaigns. 

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a significant impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."

Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars some of which happen to pulsate, and that allows us to probe their structure. From Kepler's main 
mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes to constrain structure models from period spacings and frequency multiplets. Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age- some stars show mode trapping while in others it is almost completely absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of different evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models.Frequency multiplets also tell us rotation periods and orientation of pulsation axes. From this information we can measure rotation profiles and have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary periods down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components. From K2 Campaign 1, we discovered the first known ellipsoidal variable which rotates subsynchronously. We made significant progress from the original Kepler mission. However, each sdB pulsator we have examined so far has had unique features. This tells us that we have not  completed the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). To fully exploit K1 and K2 data, we need more pulsators to cover the complete range. It would also be a huge benefit to have more examples of pulsators in binaries, as that allows us to more fully explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection. Thus far, we have discovered one solid-body rotator and one radially-differential rotator. To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing 
that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of a selection of known and likely sdB pulsators. The SC data can fully exploit pulsations and short-period (1 day) binaries. Only K2 provides sufficient accuracy, duty cycle, and duration necessary to fully understand the pulsations. There is no planned mission that can compete with the accuracy of K2. K2 really is the only tool for this work. Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including 
spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.
We will be proposing for about five to eight stars per campaign. We only apply for the most promising targets, both in terms of pulsations and interesting binary properties. We are proposing to observe two binary pulsators, EQ Psc, discovered with K2's engineering data and V1405 Ori, a rare p-mode pulsator in a short-period binary. We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include undergraduate students as significant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training. Graduate students at European partner institutions will also be working with us; processing and interpreting pulsations as part of their thesis work."

In this cycle we will be able to include three more distant open clusters (NGC 1674, NGC 1750, and NGC 1758) in our search and return to a different - and previously unexplored - part of the Hyades in K2 Campaign 13.  

o) Methods & techniques:
We will search the K2 light curves for planetary transit signatures. We will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, and high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates. We will perform detailed spectral analysis in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances, and will perform Doppler tomographic analysis of rapidly rotating planetary candidates. Our team has just confirmed two new K2 planets from field 4 (Johnson et al. 2016, ApJ, submitted)

o) Perceived significance:
These results will provide important new constraints on the physics of planetary system formation and early dynamical evolution. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."
GO12078,12,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,"Brandenburg, Axel; Guhathakurta, Puragra",Superflares and Flaring History of Old Halo G Dwarfs,"Context and Goals. Recently Shibayama et al. (2013) showed that Kepler light curves of G-dwarf stars like the Sun reveal ""superflares"" with energies of at least 10^34 ergs, a hundred times more energetic than the strongest known solar flare (e.g. Carrington 1859). This implies that the Sun itself might also produce such flares, dramatically affecting the Earth.

Although those superflaring stars not in binaries are clearly solar-like, unlike the Sun they tend to be rapid rotators (Notsu et al. 2015ab). Since they are bright and lie in the Kepler field near the Galactic plane, they could be young enough (< 1 Gyr) to retain a strong global dynamo, the suggested cause of the strong flaring. This would imply that stars as old as the Sun, 4.5 Gyr, should not undergo superflares, since the global dynamo has spun down due to magnetic braking. In contrast, Brandenburg et al. (2012) review how solar magnetic fields are generated in local small-scale dynamos via turbulence associated with convective motions, which may cause superflares in relatively inactive G stars (Candelaresi et al. 2014).

In this work, our goals are to establish whether the Sun could undergo a superflare, and whether local dynamos might generate such flaring. We will clarify the above aspects by establishing the characteristics of flaring and sunspots in G dwarf stars at least as old as the Sun. To this end we propose to obtain long-cadence Kepler 2 light curves in the halo field C12 of 987 G dwarfs with Kepler magnitudes from 16.8 to 18.5, located up to 1 kpc above the Galactic plane. The G dwarf light curves proposed here complement those of 1200 old K dwarfs we have already targeted in Stripe 82 in the K2 halo field C8. The large sample is required because superflares are rare events: Candelaresi et al. report a rate of 8 per 10^4 days per 100K for mid-K to late G dwarfs, implying detection of only ~80 GK-dwarf superflares during the K2 span of ~80 days.

All stars have at least ten observations of SDSS ugriz photometry, spread sporadically over more than a decade. Because flares are brightest in the blue and near-UV, this record can constrain the previous history of flaring in each star from the variation of the u magnitude versus the near-simultaneous griz magnitudes. In addition, Keck/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy of the flaring stars, covering 6450  9150 Å at 1.2 Å resolution (R ~ 6500), is anticipated during twilight hours in time granted for the faint giants of Andromeda (Gilbert et al. 2014). This will provide radial velocities, metallicity, and light-element to iron abundance ratios, helpful in discriminating old from young populations. We will explore trends in flaring with temperature and activity level across the entire G-K dwarf domain, and provide a catalog listing all stars showing flares that includes their stellar parameters and activity history.

Methods. Following Shibayama et al., we will find superflares from their rapid rise and subsequent slower decay, and estimate the flare energy from the maximum level relative to the background photosphere. Periodic eclipses or ellipsoidal variations will reveal stars in close binaries (Prsa et al. 2011). Sunspots and rotation periods will be detected from quasi-periodic variations using the methods of Nielsen et al. (2013), but adapted to the 80-day period. Flaring models will be updated.

Relevance. Kepler 2 is the only means currently available that is capable of obtaining light curves of sufficient sensitivity on large numbers of faint dwarfs. GK dwarfs with 16.8 < Kp < 18.5 in the halo field C12, at Galactic latitude b = 60º, are located > 1 kpc above the Galactic plane, and therefore are old stars like the Sun. Due to the low Galactic latitude of the original Kepler field, b = +13.5º, and a mean Kp ~ 14.5, the G dwarfs with superflare detections lie only ~250pc above the plane. The K2 high-latitude fields C1, C3, C6, C8, and C10 contain very few suitable faint G-type stellar targets."
GO12079,12,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,"Sharma, Sanjib; Stello, Dennis; Guhathakurta, Puragra",The K2 Remote Halo Project: Probing the Metallicity Distribution of Red Giants,"Goals. Galactic halo stellar populations provide strong constraints on star formation at the earliest epochs, and the assembly and the mass of the halo itself. The best halo tracers are K giants, for they occur in populations of all metallicities and ages, and at their high luminosities they remain visible to 100 kpc. The main obstacle is in distinguishing remote halo giants from intervening dwarfs. Spectroscopic confirmation, for example by SEGUE and LAMOST, has tried to improve the ~3% yield of giants in sparse halo fields by targeting warm red giants of low metallicity. Consequently, the underlying halo profile and metallicity distribution cannot be directly extracted from the known giant sample (Xue et al. 2014).

Here we propose to minimize this metallicity bias by distinguishing dozens of remote giants solely from Kepler 2 long-cadence light curves. Unlike multi-object spectroscopy, Kepler 2 can observe a thousand halo stars at once. This work adds ~813 faint potential red K giant targets in C12 with temperatures < 4800K, and a minimal metallicity bias, to the several hundred such targets we have already obtained in the K2 halo field C8. This should yield an unbiased sample of ~40 giants > 35 kpc. Separately we are proposing a wider search in C12 for the coolest, most luminous giants only, which should add the most distant giants at the expense of reintroducing a metallicity bias.

Our overall goal is to identify and characterize a significant sample of giants in the outer Galactic halo, beyond 35 kpc. These combined efforts extend to fainter magnitudes, as thus greater distances, the work of the Galactic Archaeology Program to characterize the inner Galactic halo. Being dependent on noisier light curves, this work sacrifices complete characterization of the asteroseismology parameters for a simple derivation of dwarf/giant status and of log g, and relies on SDSS photometry for temperature determinations. Since luminosity is metallicity-dependent in old giants, this assessment of luminosity also provides an estimate of metallicity.

Methods. Our approach here in C12 (as for  in C8) selects targets likely to be giants from the accurate ugr colors of stars in SDSS Stripe 82 (Bhatti et al. 2010). These are compared to Castelli & Kurucz (2003) model photospheres, whose reliability is verified from stars already known to be giants or dwarfs. We remove most stars with photometry more consistent with dwarfs than giants, but retain potential giants of all metallicities. Our main targets have 0.8 < (g-r)o < 1.35 and 16.2 < Kp < 18.5, too faint for APOGEE, Gaia, or GALAH. Keck/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy, covering 6450  9150 Å at 1.2 Å resolution (R ~ 6500), is anticipated for a dozen giants, during twilight hours in time granted for the faint giants of Andromeda (Gilbert et al. 2014).

Unlike dwarfs, light curves of luminous giants have a strong p-mode and granulation signal at low frequencies (e.g. Stello et al. 2014). These can be detected to Kp ~ 18.5, for which a giant with Mr = 2 is over 100 kpc distant. We have demonstrated this by measuring p-mode peaks in the power spectra of in Kepler light curves of low-metallicity APOKASC giants, breaking them into quarters and adding noise at various levels. The approach of Kallinger et al. (2016), who derive log g from the time scale of granulation and p-mode oscillations combined, is also very well suited to these faint but luminous giants, as they show.

Relevance. The original Kepler field is at low Galactic latitude, b = +13.5º, with significant and variable reddening; halo stars are swamped by less luminous stars of the disk and thick disk populations. In contrast, the C8 and C12 targets are at |b| ~ 60º, with low reddening and sightlines that run past the Galactic thick disk and well into its halo. The K2 high-latitude fields C1, C3, and C6 contained very few suitable faint K stellar targets."
GO12080,12,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,"Sharma, Sanjib; Stello, Dennis; Guhathakurta, Puragra",The K2 Ultra-Distant Red Giant Program,"Goals. Galactic halo stellar populations provide strong constraints on star formation at the earliest epochs, and the assembly and the mass of the halo itself. The best halo tracers are K giants, for they occur in populations of all metallicities and ages, and at their high luminosities they remain visible to 100 kpc. The coolest, brightest giants probe the greatest distances, but they are very rare, and difficult to distinguish from intervening dwarfs. Spectroscopic confirmation, for example by SEGUE and LAMOST, has tried to improve the ~3% yield of giants in sparse halo fields by targeting warm red giants of low metallicity. Consequently very few cool luminous halo giants at distances > 50 kpc are known in the Milky Way, although many have been uncovered in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (Gilbert et al. 2014).

Here we are undertaking to identify distant Milky Way giants from Kepler 2 long-cadence light curves. Unlike multi-object spectroscopy, Kepler 2 can observe a thousand halo stars at once. The comprehensive sky coverage of SDSS photometry in the K2 halo field C12 allows us to add 804 faint red giant targets with temperatures < 4600K to the ~1800 warm and cool K giant targets we have targeted in the K2 halo fields C6, C8, and C10. The target selection adopted here does introduce a metallicity bias, but in the opposite sense of the biases of previous halo giant surveys. Separately we are proposing a search for primarily warmer giants in a limited area of C12 with more accurate SDSS photometry, which enables a target selection with minimal bias in metallicity.

The overall goal of these proposals is to identify and characterize a significant sample of giants in the outer Galactic halo, beyond 35 kpc. Our K2 remote halo work extends to fainter magnitudes, and thus greater distances, than the work of the Galactic Archaeology Program to characterize the inner Galactic halo. Being dependent on noisier light curves, our work sacrifices full characterization of the asteroseismology parameters for a simple derivation of dwarf/giant status and of log g, and relies on SDSS photometry for temperature determinations. Since luminosity is metallicity-dependent in old giants, this also provides a metallicity estimate.

Methods. The proposed targets fall in a region in the ugri color-color diagrams predominantly occupied by giants. This is confirmed by comparing their colors to those of Castelli & Kurucz (2003) model photospheres, whose reliability is verified from stars already known to be giants or dwarfs. Our targets have 0.9 < (g-r)o < 1.35 and 16 < Kp < 18.4, too faint for APOGEE, Gaia, or GALAH.

In contrast, the C12 targets are at b = 60º, with low reddening and a sightline that runs past the Galactic thick disk into its halo. C6, C8, and C10 are at similarly high latitudes. The K2 high-latitude fields C1 and C3 contained very few suitable faint stellar targets."
GO12081,12,Ann,E.,Wehrle,Space Science Institute,awehrle@spacescience.org,"Carini, Michael Thomas; Wiita, Paul J",Jets or Disks? Using K2 to distinguish between the origins of optical variability in quasars.,"We propose to measure the  long cadence light curves  of a large sample of 417 quasars in Campaign 12 and  2 quasars in Campaign 13. By doubling the size of our currently approved samples, we will increase the number of AGN in which K2 detects variability enough to form  good statistical samples in each quasar class. The AGN are drawn primarily from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Parkes radio surveys, and the 2nd Fermi LAT AGN catalog. They include 4 gamma-ray blazars. Many quasars have been observed in the PanSTARRS Medium Deep Field 10.  Our ongoing K2 observations have already detected significant optical variability in ~ 88% of gamma-ray blazars, including binary black hole candidate OJ 287, ~ 16% of radio loud quasars (RLQs), and ~ 5% of radio quiet quasars (RQQs). 

Our  first goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in the quasars at the time of K2 observations. Three candidate
origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk  with one or more thermal emitting regions. 

Our  second  goal is to see how the optical variability amplitude and power spectral densities of the three main classes of quasars -- blazars, radio loud quasars, and radio quiet quasars -- differ on minute-to-months timescales. We will measure the power spectral densities of the light curves and determine the power spectral density slopes which are related to the underlying variability processes, such as turbulence in the relativistic jets or stochastic fluctuations in thermal emission from segments of the accretion disk."
GO12082,12,Michal,,Siwak,Cracov Pedagogical University,michal.siwak@gmail.com,,A photometric study of pre-main sequence stars,"We propose to continue space-based Kepler photometric monitoring of pre-main sequence stars. In our study we concentrate on Classical T Tauri-type stars (CTTS), well known from rapid and complicated variability due to vigorous accretion of disc plasma. A sample of above 200 stars is proposed for observations, mostly the members of Taurus-Auriga Star Forming Region (Campaign 11 - 50 targets, 12 - 5 targets, 13 - 151 targets). They will provide first large representative sample of stars (both known in Simbad database as YSOs, CTTSs, Herbig Ae/Be, WTTSs, PMSs and carefuly choosen objects classified as emision line stars) of different age and SFR membership to address the following issues: 
1) regime of accretion in CTTS: stable, moderately stable or unstable,
2) does the accretion regime in CTTS alternate between (moderately)stable and unstable, what is the typical timescale,
3) which Herbig Ae/Be stars show magnetically-controlled accretion like CTTS,
4) study of QPOs in CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars with wavelet technique: how fast do they change in time
5) determination of rotational periods of CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars if catched in a stable or moderately stable accretion regime, as well as of WTTS modulated by long lived cold spots (including differential rotation),
6) do other CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars show short lasting, shallow dips like TW Hya,
7) does HBC 393 show tiny (amplitude of 1-10%) QPOs, like these discovered by us with MOST for FU Ori in 2009/10 and confirmed in 2013/14 (unpublished,) which may allow for determination of an inner disc radius ?,
8) will we be lucky enough to discover planetary transit around one of the young stars?

Among the proposed targets is HL Tau and LkCa 15, famous from their stunning ALMA and high-contrast images, likely revealing effects of disc-planet interactions and forming protoplanet(s), respectively. To get comparison with photometrically best observed so far from space TW Hya, we will likely ask to observe them in a short-cadence mode. Due to obvious spacecraft limitations, the other targets must be observed in a long-cadence mode only. We propose to observe only these stars which are bright enough for Kepler and well-separated to get accurate photometric precision. The only problem is expected with HBC 393, which may be too faint for Kepler. Yet, we propose to make an attempt to observe the star as it is the only FUor available for it in the closest future.
     Approved Kepler observations of brightest targets, especially CTTS, will be supported by ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic observations to estimate variety of their physical parameters. For this purpose we plan to use Polish access on SALT, SAAO and ESO telescopes."
GO12083,12,Adam,Gabriel,Jensen,University of Nebraska-Kearney,JensenAG@unk.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson; Endl, Michael; Redfield, Seth",Searching for Extended Exoplanetary Atmospheres Around Active Stars,"A key question in studying any planetary atmosphere is what happens at the boundary between the atmosphere and interplanetary space. This unbound, outermost layer of an atmosphere is called its exosphere.  Several observations of extended atmospheres have been made (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Schlawin et al. 2010; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010, 2012; Fossati et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2012; Cauley et al. 2015; Cauley et al. 2016, in preparation) in hydrogen (both ground-state and excited) and various metals.

Our team detected excited, n=2 hydrogen (through hydrogen alpha absorption) in the exosphere of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012), the first such detection in an exoplanet atmosphere. Follow-up observations (Cauley et al. 2015; Cauley et al. 2016, in prep.) confirmed this result by detecting exospheric absorption in hydrogen alpha, hydrogen beta, and hydrogen gamma, and also observed a significant pre-transit signal in these lines.  The pre-transit signal is variable between the two observation sets and the physical interpretation is not clear.  Jensen et al. (2012) hypothesized that the excited hydrogen in the exosphere (the transit signal) may be correlated with chromospheric activity, as HD 189733b, the only planet in that paper's sample of four planets to show H-alpha absorption, was also the most chromospherically active in the sample (as measured by S_HK and log [R'_HK] indices).

In Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 3, we proposed to search for planets around stars which are candidates for chromospheric activity in the Kepler 8 and 10 fields.  We found dozens of suitable targets based on the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Survey's catalogue of chromospherically active stars (Zerjal et al. 2013).  We now propose to do the same for Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 4 for the Kepler Campaign 11, 12, and 13 fields.  Because the 11 and 12 fields are in the southern celestial hemisphere, these are largely covered by the RAVE survey in particular, whereas the RAVE survey mostly covered field 10.  Therefore, we expect to have roughly double the number of targets for this cycle as we did in the previous cycle, roughly tripling the overall sample.  This will greatly improve the chance of success of the accepted Cycle 3 proposal at minimal cost of targets to the K2 mission.

Looking for planets around active stars with radial velocity methods is often disfavored because the stellar noise limits RV precision.  However, this makes the transit method the more important way to detect planets in these cases. Furthermore, if any of these stars do have a transiting planet, they will be excellent potential candidates for follow-up spectroscopy with the large ground-based telescopes (Keck I, HobbyEberly Telescope) that our team has used in the past to detect exospheric absorption. The goal of follow-up spectroscopic observations would be to search for excited hydrogen absorption from an exosphere, including possible pre-transit signals. As a secondary science product, many of these active stars will have light curves worth studying on their own for stellar astrophysics purposes."

Rotation periods, in particular, provide important clues to the physics behind the formation and evolution of stars and subsequent planetary systems. When the latter are detected, studying the relation between the orbital period of the planet(s) and the rotation period of the parent star can also shed light on the spin-orbit alignment and on the angular momentum history of the system (e.g. Bouvier et al. 2013). In addition, stellar activity due to rotation and/or pulsations affects the measured radial velocity signature of the host star, and can even mimic inferred Keplerian motion. 

Prior to NASAs Kepler mission, stellar rotation was typically deduced from spectroscopy using the rotationally-broadened absorption line profiles. This technique, however, is both expensive in terms of telescope time, and more importantly, suffers from degeneracies stemming from its dependency on the a-priori unknown stellar radius and obliquity; it is also tailored to fast rotators. The mission has truly revolutionized the field, offering, for the first time, continuous monitoring of stellar flux allowing precise measurements of the rotation periods of tens of thousands of stars (e.g. McQuillan, Mazeh & Aigrain 2014). K2 builds up on this legacy, offering new opportunities to study stellar variability in a variety of settings  stars at the bottom of the main sequence, white dwarfs, binaries, stars in open clusters, etc (e.g. Kawaler 2014, Scholz et al. 2015, Rebel et al. 2016). 

Here we propose to observe 9 exoplanet-candidate host stars (1 transiting and 8 RV planets), study their long-term stellar activity and measure their photometrically-modulated rotation periods. Our targets span a range of stellar types (from K giants to M dwarfs), of planetary periods (from 3 days to 5 years) and masses/sizes (from ~2.5 REarth to ~10MJup). The rotation periods for six targets have been inferred from spectroscopically-measured vsin i (with various degree of confidence) and model-dependent radius. These periods range from 20 to 60 days  ideally suited for robust detection and confirmed by K2. For three of the targets the rotation periods are unknown. In addition, the nature of some of these candidates suffers from degeneracy between the measured radial velocities and inferred Keplerian motions. 

Our program will a) provide direct measurements for the rotation periods; b) break degeneracies between stellar rotation and exoplanetary orbits; and c) allow for comprehensive characterization of these systems. In combination with v sin i measurements (where available), our results will also allow model-independent measurements of the stellar radii. In addition, the observations will be sensitive to transits caused by additional exoplanets, and in the case of the one transiting planet  to transit timing variations. While there are ground-based photometric measurements for some of our targets, none of the available data compares to the precision, quality and uninterrupted monitoring of K2, making the observatory uniquely-suited for the proposed investigation. Thus our program will add to the growing legacy of stellar activity research enabled by the mission, provide input for gyrochronological studies, and offer new insight into the stellar astrophysics of these planet-hosting stars. The proposed study will directly support NASAs goal to Discover and study planets around other stars, in order to understand the underlying physical processes of exoplanets and to improve understanding of their origins."

Scientific Justification
We request K2 monitoring of unidentified and known X-ray sources in Campaigns 11 through 13, compiled from a variety of sources including the Chandra Source Catalog and the Million Quasar Catalog, to probe accretion onto compact objects at a variety of mass and time scales. Our KSwAGS survey found 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., 2015). Approximately half were active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various types (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring M-stars). A Kepler GO survey (PI: Still) of Chandra point sources resulted in a similar distribution of stars to active galaxies. High precision optical follow-up is scientifically useful for all sources; the AGN allow for a study of variability characteristics as a function of SMBH mass (Smith et al., 2015) and the stars allow for the study of a variety of rapid rotators and chromospheric activity (Howell et al., 2016). We received time for K2 to monitor KSwAGS sources in Field 4, and Field 8. This proposal has identical scientific goals and will continue the K2 optical monitoring of X-ray sources, but with target selection criteria that relies on archival X-ray observations only and not on new Swift pointings.

Previous AGN in the original Kepler field were selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012). These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 10^8 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum is dominated by starlight rather than AGN light (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2012). Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be constrained by a ~80-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks. This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk). This further monitoring will critically enhance the sample numbers of K2-monitored AGN discovered using a relatively unbiased selection method. We expect on the order of 100 targets in Fields 11 and 13, and about 60 in Field 12.

Methodology and Relevance to NASA Astrophysics Science Goals
We aim to use K2s impressive photometric precision to detect characteristic variability timescales using Fourier analysis. These timescales are the only possible direct observables of AGN accretion physics, which remains an important astrophysical mystery and directly addresses NASA Astrophysics goal to ""[d]iscover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars."".  Additionally, these X-ray selected targets will fill in the phase-space of black hole mass and accretion rate, complementing our work in the original Kepler field."
GO12094,12,Michael,Thomas,Carini,Western Kentucky University,mike.carini@wku.edu,,Rapid Optical Variability in Infrared and Optically Bright blazars,"Blazars are extreme examples of the phenomena known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak or completely absent discrete spectral features leaves us with only continuum variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F11, F12 and F13 field of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of blazars with Kep magnitude < 18 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip (WIBRaLS) that are not previously identified blazars. The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of tens of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density on timescales from tens of minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to lengthen the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies. This is a continuation of a program started in K2 Cycle 1. Our results so far show that the observed variability is characterized by linear trends with timescales of tens of days at the 5-20% level with shorter timescale, smaller discrete events and/or changes in slope present. A minority of sources display more complicated, violent variability behavior. A PSD analysis revealed PSD slopes in the range of -1.2 to -3.03, consistent with what is generally seen in blazar light curves."

Even though many eclipsing binaries were observed by Kepler, almost none were done at short cadence, which prevented from detecting solar-like oscillations of systems composed of main-sequence and sub-giant stars. The main purpose of this series of proposals is to access such kind of systems. 

Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. As illustrated by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, asteroseismology is an efficient method to measure masses, radii, and ages of large numbers of stars, which is of prime importance to test stellar evolution. However, a crucial test of both asteroseismic masses and radii of a large sample of stars with independent measurements of those quantities has not yet been carried out. Eclipsing binary systems (EBs) potentially permit such an exercise by allowing for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, provided that spectral lines are detectable for both components. EBs are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough (e.g. Gaulme et al. 2014). 

So far, all published stars known to both display solar-like oscillations and belong to EBs are red-giants (RGs), and all have been detected by the Kepler mission. The first detection was the 408-day period system KIC 8410637 (Hekker et al. 2010, Frandsen et al. 2013). Since then, Gaulme et al. (2013 & 2014) reported a list 18 RG eclipsing-binary (RG/EB) candidates, of which 14 displayed oscillations. Beck et al. (2014 & 2015) reported the discovery of 18 stars with tidally excited pulsations (``heartbeat''), where each system has a RG component with oscillations, and three are also EBs. Two of these systems, KIC 8410637 and 9246715 have been completely characterized by combining photometry and radial velocities (Frandsen et al. 2013, Rawls et al. 2016). Both show a fairly good agreement between asteroseismic and photo-dynamical estimates of surface gravity and mean density, even though (Huber et al. 2014) contested the agreement regarding KIC  8410637. Provided that oscillations are detected, observing known EBs with K2 is a unique opportunity to extend the sample of systems to test asteroseismology. 

The purpose of this GO proposal is to observe a small set (maximum 6 per field) of eclipsing binaries that are already well characterized in terms of physical parameters (orbits, masses, radii). Doing so present two main advantages. Firstly, observing well-known systems helps predicting the likelihood of detecting solar-like oscillations. Secondly, the objective is to optimally focus our available resources for ground-based follow-up observations on the most rewarding targets. High-resolution spectroscopy is very time consuming, when one is aiming for precise radial velocities and high signal-to-noise data that serves as input for spectral-disentangling techniques. 

Funding will be requested to pay a graduate student for a 1-year and two trips to Europe, where most of the asteroseismic conferences/workshops are held.

The field has transformed from simple identification to comprehensive categorization and characterization of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems. Analyses of data provided by the NASA's Kepler mission has revolutionized this field by compiling a statistically significant number of transiting planets and planetary candidates, providing time series data for a large sample of systems that can be utilized in consistent comparative studies (e.g. Angerhausen et al., 2015). 

One promising new way to further characterize some of these transiting systems are methods using ground-based multi-object spectrographs for transit and eclipse spectrophotometry such as GMOS in the optical (e.g. Stevenson et al., 2014; Huitson et al., 2016, in prep.) or MOSFIRE in the infrared (e.g. Crossfield et al., 2013; Morris et al, 2016, in prep.). These emerging ground-based methods allow access to larger apertures and better time-sampling of transit lightcurves than equivalent HST methods. They therefore have the potential to observe transits at the precisions achievable from space but at a fraction of the cost and with the possibility of repeated measurements to further increase reliability. Importantly, ground-based telescopes have access to the full optical wavelength range and so will be highly complementary to JWST.

However, these ground-based methods are constrained by the need for similarly bright comparison stars in close neighborhood to the observed host star of the transiting system. In order to reduce instrumental systematics and optimize the time-sampling at the level needed for high-precision transit atmosphere observations, the comparison stars must be bright, of similar magnitude to the exoplanet host star and be within a few arcmin. 

To identify ideal candidates for ground-based characterization studies, we therefore we propose to use the single, visible wavelength instrument on board of K2 to obtain high-precision long cadence photometry on of the best suited pairs of similarly bright stars (mag < 11.5, separation < 5 arcmin). Assuming an occurrence of well-vetted planet candidates with P d 30 d of about ~2%, we expect to find ~20 planets that will be accessible for spectrophotometric atmospheric characterization from the ground.

The goal of high precision time resolved photometry is to reduce or in the best case remove all noise to achieve photon-noise limited photometry. After years of experience with these data a number of best practices for their handling have emerged: For the reduction and preparation of K2 data as well as for the planet search in the reduced data, we have access to a number of standard procedures that are already widely used in the community (e.g. the PyKe tools, Barclay & Still 2012; K2 specific best practices, Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015; or SIP, Angus et al. 2015). 

Finding these extremely valuable targets will enable us to do exactly the kind of basic research that advances our knowledge by characterization of planets and planetary systems outside of our Solar System in order to determine their compositions, dynamics, energetics, and chemical behaviors. The proposed study will directly support NASAs goal to Discover and study planets around other stars, in order to understand the underlying physical processes of exoplanets and to improve understanding of their origins.

GO12099,12,Fred,C.,Adams,University of Michigan,fca@umich.edu,"Becker, Juliette C; Vanderburg, Andrew",Searching for Transit Timing Variations the Hot Jupiter  WASP-28,"We request a short cadence observation of WASP-28, the only known hot Jupiter in Campaign 12. K2 short cadence data of known hot Jupiters has yielded the first discovery of a system containing not only a hot Jupiter but also nearby, short-period planetary companions (Becker, Vanderburg, Adams et al 2015). For years, it has been predicted that planetary companions to transiting hot Jupiters could be found via the presence of transit-timing variations (TTVs), which have been predicted to be measurable for hot Jupiters (Agol et al. 2005, Holman et al 2005). However, studies looking for these signals of additional planetary companions (e.g.,  Steffen et al. 2012) have not found any such companions, despite the large quantity of transit data for hot Jupiter-hosting stars provided by the original Kepler mission. The observed paucity of these companions could be interpreted as support for particular migratory mechanisms (such as high eccentricity migration; Mustill 2015), so it is extremely important to understand whether hot Jupiters are truly alone or not. In Campaign 3, K2 found a hot Jupiter system (WASP-47) that hosts two additional close-in planets, the first system of its kind to ever be found. 
Although many hot Jupiters have been discovered by ground-based photometry (such as all of the WASP planets), precision from the ground is not high enough to either directly detect additional planets or to detect TTVs for the hot Jupiter with a precision that could discover small planetary companions. Only K2s short cadence data mode is capable of achieving this level of precision. In Becker et al. (2015), the hot Jupiter WASP-47b exhibited a 0.63 minute TTV amplitude. As shown in Figure 1, this amplitude is large enough to be extracted cleanly from K2 short cadence data, but it would be impossible to measure from long cadence data (as the transit duration for a hot Jupiter is generally only a couple hours). We request that WASP-28 be observed in 1-minute cadence during campaign 12. The resulting data will allow us to check for transit timing variations as well as direct photometric evidence of companions. Since close-in companions to hot Jupiters will be short-period, short-cadence data would detect several orbits of the companions (if they exist), and place strict limits on companion presence if no detection is made. This data will be useful in the long-term as legacy data, as future transit observations can be stacked with those made by K2 and better characterize the long term behavior and TTVs in the system.

GO12103,12,Jennifer,,Patience,ASU,jennifer.patience@asu.edu,"De Rosa, Robert John; Aguilar, Jonathan A; Nielsen, Eric L; Greenbaum, Alexandra; Bastien, Fabienne Anne",K2 Monitoring Direct of Direct Imaging Planet Search Survey Stars,"We propose to use NASAs K2 to monitor 14 stars selected from ground-based direct imaging surveys that fall in Campaigns 11, 12, 13, in order to measure variations that result from rotation of surface features, stellar flares, and seismic activity. Direct imaging surveys target young stars that are good candidates for hosting gas giant planets at 10s of AU separation and protoplanetary or debris disks. The stars in our sample are chosen from GPIES (Macintosh et al. 2013), SPHERE (Bezuit et al. 2008), NICI (Wahaj et al. 2013, Nielsen et al., 2013, Biller et al., 2013), and SEEDS (Brandt et al. 2014) public target lists. They have been age-dated primarily by lithium, placement on the HR diagram, or by association to moving groups at young ages. 

The inferred properties of planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions discovered through direct imaging are often model dependent (e.g. Burrows et al. 1997, Baraffe et al. 2003), relying heavily on their age estimates. Identifying older systems that appear young from other estimates will improve the analysis of any circumstellar material (including companions), as well as survey statistics regarding the overall population and formation trends of long-period planets. Additionally, the stellar magnetic field environment can affect orbit evolution of companions as well as dust grain properties in disks. The stellar properties of direct imaging targets are an important component of understanding planet forming populations. 

Our program has three major goals, (1) to find potentially misidentified stellar ages in our sample through asteroseismology, (2) to measure stellar rotation periods to combine with radial velocity measurements from other facilities, and (3) to detect stellar flares in order to better understand the circumstellar environments where planets form and disks evolve. As more direct imaging target stars are monitored with K2, comparing their existing age estimates with newly measured rotational properties can help to explain angular momentum loss in young stars that may host planets. 

We propose short cadence observations in order to detect variations due to seismic activity and resolve detailed morphology of stellar flares. These observations will also provide rotational periods for each of our targets. Combining rotation rates with vsini measurements will resolve the inclination of the stellar axis for systems with potential planetary mass companions and/or disks. Measuring flaring properties of the stars in our sample will indicate the magnetic fields present in the circumstellar region, which is an important component to fully understanding the planet formation process. Finally, asteroseismology may be able to identify stars that are older than other age-dating methods have suggested."

Our knowledge of these processes is very limited, and this lack of understanding results in large uncertainties on current stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars. As these models are important cornerstones for several fields of modern astrophysics (e.g., chemical enrichment of galaxies, stellar life cycles and their effects on star and planetary system formation, dynamics of stellar clusers, etc.), these shortcomings need to be resolved.

Asteroseismology is one of the few tools that allow us to study the interiors of stars by the interpretation of their pulsation signal. The last decade brought an immense revolution to the field thanks to the succes of space telescopes such as CoRoT and Kepler, and thanks to vast improvements of asteroseismological techniques. The frequency spectra of the pulsating beta Cep and slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are strongly influenced by the mentioned mixing processes (e.g., Miglio et al. 2008, MNRAS, 386, 1487), which makes them ideal asteroseismic probes.

Even in the era of space-based telescopes, observations of OB stars are a rarity, not only because of their relatively low number compared to Solar-like and KM dwarves, but also because they are preferably avoided by missions driven by exoplanet detections. While the nominal Kepler mission delivered a revolution in stellar physics for Solar-like stars and red giants, it only added a few stars to the still less than two dozens of OB dwarves where in-depth studies managed to put at least some constraints on the extent of the overshoot region around the core, or on the internal rotation profile (Aerts 2015, IAUS, 307, 154A). Even more striking is that there is only one star where a full actual seismic modelling was carried out based on gravity modes, resulting in stringent constraints on the core overshoot (Papics et al. 2014, A&A, 570, A8) and the diffusive mixing (Moravveji et al. 2015, A&A, 580, A27), culminating in an inversion of the internal rotation profile (Triana et al. 2015, ApJ, 810, 16). The few available observational studies have demonstrated that the richness of variable behaviour among these stars is so large that the details in their internal physics must be different. This means that we need to map the whole extent of the instability strip with in-depth seismic modelling efforts to find the connection between the fundamental parameters and the internal mixing properties of these stars. This is the only way we can calibrate the stellar structure and evolution models of massive stars.

We propose the observation of 35 potential B-type pulsators, that have been selected based on spectral type and brightness. We propose stars where we can conduct simultaneous and follow-up observations with the high-resolution HERMES spectrograph and the 3-channel MAIA CCD camera installed on the 1.2 meter Mercator Telescope on La Palma (operated by the host institute of the PI).

Our methodology is as follows: we do frequency analysis on the detrended K2 data, then we attempt mode identification using period- and frequency-spacing patterns, or  if this is not possible  using multicolour photometry or time-resolved high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. This is followed by forward modelling of the zonal modes. We iterate over theoretical frequency sets calculated using different input physics to fine-tune the equilibrium models until we reach the best fit. This will result in a new generation of stellar structure models. There might be stars that are found to be non pulsating, but these non-detections coupled with precise spectroscopy will be also very useful to validate the current excitation calculations, especially since at the moment the predicted instability strips on the HRD are still very undersampled in terms of observational data."
GO12109,12,Bram,D,Buysschaert,"Institute for Astronomy, KU Leuven",bram.buysschaert@ster.kuleuven.be,"Aerts, Conny Clara; Neiner, Coralie; Oksala, Mary Elizabeth; Briquet, Maryline",K2 Asteroseismology of hot magnetic stars,"About 10% of hot stars host a magnetic field at their stellar surface, detectable with current ground-based spectropolarimeters (Grunhut & Neiner 2015,IAUS,305,53). The interaction of these fields with certain layers deep inside the star and influence internal physical processes is poorly understood, and can alter the efficiency of the internal mixing of chemical species or have a crucial role in angular momentum transport. Therefore, magnetic fields are important for the stellar structure and evolution of a significant number of hot stars.

We thus use asteroseismology to probe the stellar interior by studying their stellar pulsations. Tremendous progress in asteroseismology has been made over the last decade, with space-based missions providing a vast amount of data, and significantly improved seismic techniques. However, the number of hot magnetic pulsators studied with high precision space-based photometry is limited.

Theoretically, magnetic Ap/Bp stars should exhibit various pulsational behaviours (see Aerts et al. 2010, Springer, for a detailed overview). Bp and late A stars host heat-driven gravity modes, SPB and gamma Dor pulsators, respectively, probing the core region of the star. Pulsating early A stars are either classified as roAp stars or as delta Sct pulsators, which probe the outer regions of the star. The former exhibit high-order stochastic magneto-acoustic modes, while the latter have low-order pressure modes. Those heat-driven modes, observed with a high precision thanks to the long timebase, are necessary to perform successful seismic and stellar modelling, inferring the connection between stellar magnetic fields and their internal properties.

The magnetic fields observed in 10% of hot stars, and in particular in all Ap/Bp stars, are of fossil origin, i.e. remnants from the magnetic field of the original molecular cloud from which the star formed, possibly enhanced by a dynamo during the very early stages of stellar evolution. These fields have a simple configuration, most often a dipole inclined to the rotation axis. Magnetic fields are also responsible for peculiar chemical surface abundances. Combining magnetic information with a seismic study enables us to put strong constraints on stellar models, providing information about the stellar surface, through the magnetic study and the deep interior through asteroseismology. Moreover, comparing the amount of mixing obtained by asteroseismology for magnetic hot stars with that of non-magnetic objects would allow us to corroborate or disprove the theoretical prediction that magnetic fields inhibit mixing in stellar interiors.

At present, only two magnetic pulsating stars have been studied in such a detailed manner, beta Cep (Shibahasi & Aerts 2000,ApJ,531,L143) and V2052 Oph (Briquet et al. 2012,MNRAS,27,483). Although magnetic fields have been detected in a number of other pulsating stars, there has been no detailed seismic modelling, due to the current lack of either asteroseismic data for those stars or modelling of their magnetic field with this proposal, we aim to increase better understand how the stellar magnetic field influences non-standard mixing processes governing the interior of hot stars. Moreover, by combining this study with other K2 campaigns, we will reach a statistically significant number of hot magnetic stars.

The photometric accuracy and the high duty-cycle of K2 is best suited to reach our science goals. State-of-the-art modelling tools will translate seismic information to detailed stellar models. Spectropolarimetric observations will be obtained with ESPaDOnS or Narval. In total, 14 hot magnetic stars are observable in Fields 11 to 13. Although the proposed targets might show variability on short timescales, we can work with long cadence data to study the low order p modes and all possible g modes, as demonstrated by Saio et al.2015 (MNRAS,444,3264)."

Space data of these crucial objects have led to a giant leap forward in our understanding of their structure and evolution through the discovery of new dynamical phenomena. Moreover, insight into these stars dynamics is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond.
Throughout the K2 Mission we have been building up a unique database of high precision RR Lyrae light curves from field to field, covering different parts of our Galaxy, and beyond. Our strategy assures that galactic structure studies and statistical analysis of pulsation properties (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko modulation, period doubling, low-dimensional chaos, non-radial modes) based on K2 data will be possible. Besides the ensemble studies, the boutique analysis of individual stars will be equally interesting and important. 

Targets
---------
Field 11 covers parts of the bulge where tens of thousands of RR Lyrae stars reside. For this proposal we selected about 1200 stars based on the OGLE-IV survey and an additional 400 stars from other sources covering the rest of the field of view. The OGLE survey discovered many stars with peculiar pulsation and modulation properties. Low-amplitude additional modes have been observed in all RR Lyrae subtypes, but their origins and occurrence rates are still largely unknown. We also included modulated RRc stars in the list. While the Blazhko effect in fundamental-mode stars has been studied extensively from space, the sample of modulated RRc stars is still scarce.  

In Field 12 we selected about 200 stars. 8 RR Lyrae stars were previously observed during the K2-E2 Engineering Test run, including a fundamental-mode star where we tentatively identified a frequency component as a g-mode signal. Re-observation of these targets present a unique opportunity to reassess our earlier findings that were based on only 9 days of data. It will also show us how did the accuracy of Kepler evolve since the early tests.  
For a number of RR Lyrae stars extensive multicolor photometry is available from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Field survey. The detailed color information will be a valuable addition to the K2 light curves. Beside the RR Lyrae stars, we also found an additional 30 variables belonging to various classes that we also include in this proposal.   

Field 13, towards the Galactic anticenter direction, contains 103 known RR Lyrae stars. One priority target here is BR Tau that has a short modulation period of only ~19 days. 

Methods and planned community resources
---------------------------------------------------
Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. Metallicities will be derived from empirical relations calibrated with high-resolution spectra. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations.
Photometry of large-amplitude pulsators require special treatment, and general-purpose pipelines may provide RR Lyrae light curves with sub-optimal quality. We already released tailor-made photometry from some Kepler data sets. We intend to create custom light curves for the stars listed in this proposal too, and plan to employ special methods like differential-image photometry for the bulge field. As a value-added community resource we envisage a searchable database containing the light curves, frequency solutions and other parameters (Blazhko periods, additional modes, etc.) of the RR Lyrae stars observed by K2."
GO12113,12,Ehsan,,Moravveji,KU Leuven,Ehsan.Moravveji@ster.kuleuven.be,"Pollard, Karen Rylvia; de Mink, Selma E; Sana, Hugues AA; Aerts, Conny Clara; Moya, Andy; Simon-Diaz, Sergio; Castro, Norberto; Buysschaert, Bram D; Kambe, Eiji; Saio, Hideyuki",UPBEAT: Unravelling Pulsations of BluE supergiAnTs,"Introduction. Blue Supergiant (BSG) stars are early-type massive (>3 Msun) stars found at their post-main sequence evolution phase. Due to their impact on galactic evolution (triggering starburst, and metal enrichment) they are critical objects to study. Several physical aspect of BSG evolution is still poorly understood; specifically, there is no clear census of binarity among BSGs. As young objects, they reside predominantly in the Galactic plane. Surface He and CNO abundances in BSGs exhibit a significant excess compared to their main sequence progenitors, rendering the rotational mixing a plausible explanation (Przybilla et al. 2010, A&A). BSGs exhibit photometric and spectroscopic variabilities (see Moravveji et al. 2012a, ApJ, for an example) due to radial/nonradial oscillations, episodic mass loss (Aerts et al. 2010, A&ALett), rotating spot(s) at the photosphere, and/or ellipsoidal variability possibly due to the presence of a close companion. UPBEAT aims to characterise and quantify these variability mechanisms involved in Galactic BSGs by combining K2 space photometry with time-resolved ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy.

Feasibility. The K2 photometry of 10 BSGs in the engineering Field 0 proved that this instrument is capable of detecting BSG varibilities. Thus, the unique capabilities of K2 is well suited for our proposed project. The Campaign 0 provided only ~30 days of useful data for asteroseismic purposes (see e.g. Buysschaert et al. 2015, MNRAS). This limitation is improved by the instrument pointing stability and the ~80 day contiguous observations since Field 2. Thus, the resulting light curves will not suffer from daily aliasing, and is quite optimal for characterization of BSG variabilities. The K2's point-to-point photometric scatter is ~50 ppm. Based on our experience with BSGs in Campaign 0, K2 photometry is precise enough to characterise and quantify flux variability due to different underlying reasons. Thus, UPBEAT can feasibly exploit K2's capabilities.

Impact. During Campaign 11, K2 visits the Galactic plane (maybe for the last time). This is a unique and time-critical opportunity, because the next planned mission to deliver such high-quality uninterrupted space photometry is PLATO, to be launched after ~2024. The ~8 year observation gap between now and 2024 can only be filled with K2. Space photometry of BSGs, at the precision and cadence offered by K2, is scarce; thus, K2 will leave a valuable legacy data behind for scrutinizing the physics of the upper Herzsprung-Russel diagram for the next decade(s). UPBEAT seizes this opportunity by focusing on a sample of Galactic BSGs.

Objectives. We have already proposed 38 BSGs for the Campaign 9 (DDT); by the time we are submitting this proposal, we are still unaware of the NASA/K2 peer-review decision. Here, we propose observation of additional 40 OB-type BSGs between Kp=8 and 16 magnitude in fields 11, 12 and 13. We guarantee high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy with HERMES@Mercator for targets with Kp <12, and spectroscopic monitoring for those brighter than Kp ~10 mag. We will use other instruments (UVES@VLT and/or HDS@Subaru) for targets fainter than Kp ~12 mag. The combined photometry and spectroscopy will be used to (a) identify or exclude pulsation variability, (b) draw the observational instability strips, and confront that with our predictions (Moravveji 2016, MNRAS) (c) explore the pulsation excitation mechanism (epsilon- versus kappa-mechanism, Moravveji et al. 2012b, ApJ). (d) carry out iterative frequency prewhitening, and search for regularities in frequency and/or periods, (e) characterize possible rotating spots, (f) test the hypothesis that macroturbulence velocity has pulsation origin, (g) trace the surface chemical and rotational velocity evolution, with a possible link to rotational and/or non-rotational mixing processes, and (h) disentangle apparent single stars versus close binaries."
GO12114,12,Andras,,Pal,MTA CsFK,apal@szofi.net,"Szabo, Robert; Mueller, Thomas G; Kiss, Laszlo; Kiss, Csaba",K2 photometry of a large sample of trans-Neptunian objects,"Our recent studies (Pal et al. 2015, 2016, Kiss et al 2016) have demonstrated that the K2 mission is an excellent opportunity to obtain rotational properties of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Using long-cadence Kepler photometry focusing on the stationary points of the apparent tracks of these objects, light curves with excellent quality can be obtained, from which one can constrain the rotation period, surface inhomogeneities, the shape of the object and decide, whether the true rotation period corresponds to a single-peaked or double-peaked solution.

We propose to observe 13+9+9 Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects throughout the Campaigns 11, 12 and 13, respectively, of the K2 programme. From our list of proposed targets, 8 also have been observed in the framework of the ``TNOs are Cool!'' open-time key programme of the Herschel Space Observatory (Muller et al. 2009), therefore an unambiguous rotational characteristics can be combined with an unambiguous diameter and surface albedo for these objects. This sample of ours covers various dynamical types of the population of objects outside the main asteroid belt, including 5 Centaurs, 13 classical objects, 4 scattered disk objects and 9 resonant objects. One of the resonant objects has 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune (namely 2012 VU85, a Trojan of Neptune) as well as there are four Plutinos, i.e. objects in 2:3 mean-motion resonance with Neptune.

None of targets having Herschel/PACS thermal photometry have a currently known accurate rotation period (note: 2005 TB190 has ground-based observations confirming variability but with several aliases, see also Thirouin et al. 2012). Hence, the K2 time series also aids the proper interpretation of thermal emission measurements. All of the targets having Herschel photometry fall on silicon for quite long time (60+ days) with the exception of Borasisi. This object is a binary system with a period of 46.3 days (Noll et al. 2004). Hence, the total time of 13+10 days when K2 is capable to perform photometry would not cover the binary period, however, even this shorter track could confirm or constrain whether the objects have a synchronous rotation or not.

Due to the number of these targets and the comparatively large pixel cost w.r.t the stellar sources, we prioritize our targets according to their brightness (i.e. the effective S/N ratio of the rotational light curve) as well as the existence of thermal infrared data. Our top priority objects include all of the objects having Herschel/PACS photometry. We also indicated 2012 VU85 with priority 1. Priority 2 objects are either bright or have interesting dynamical properties. We note that even the faintest (priority 3) objects have comparable brightness to that of 2002 GV31. This object was also successfully observed by K2, yielding a folded light curve with good signal-to-noise ratio and an unambiguous rotation period (Pal et al. 2015). We also note that the first minor body discovered in the outer Solar System, (2060) Chiron fell on silicon during Campaign 12. Due to the different nature of K2 data acquisition, the science case of (2060) Chiron is described in a separate proposal.

We propose a Large K2 Program to monitor ~2500 bright galaxies in Campaign C12 which should yield 2-5 great light curves (LCs) of supernovae. In Kepler GO programs, we identified 3 SN Ia (Olling et al. 2015), 2 SN IIP (Garnavich et al., in press; Tucker et al., submitted), and 1 SN IIn/Ia-csm (Garnavich et al., in prep.). We also found that ~4% of our galaxies display AGN activity with variability at >0.001% level (Shaya et al 2015). In K2 Campaigns C3, C5, and C6 we identified 3, 3, and 2 SNe, respectively, two of which were spectroscopically classified. Analysis of the K2 data is ongoing.

With our program, we plan to determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe using features in the early breakout (t < 4 days) LCs; explore the explosion physics of SN, especially SN Ia, using subtle features during their rise (t < 20 days); improve the calibration of SN Ia as standard candles for measuring distances, Ho, and dark energy using K2 LCs of unprecedented detail; and add significant knowledge to the virtually unexplored very low-Eddington regime of AGN.

There is an ongoing controversy over the basic physics of one of the key tools in cosmology, the SN Ia standard candle. Do SNe Ia gradually reach critical mass via accretion from a companion star or does it merge with another WD? If a white dwarf had been accreting mass from a companion star, as the ejecta reaches the companion a shock would form with observable optical emission (Kasen 2010). The emission would be short and strongest from certain viewing angles, requiring rapid cadence for several SNe before definitive conclusions can be reached. For the 3 SN Ia discovered by Kepler monitoring of ~500 galaxies (Olling et al. 2015), no signatures of a companion were found and tight constraints were placed. With a larger sample, we can determine the statistics for the two possible channels that trigger SN Ia. Meanwhile, features due to the different explosion physics (detonation, deflagration, inwards-moving diffusion waves, etc) of Ia and core collapse SNe will also be revealed. K2 will allow for the first time to test models more complicated than simple ""expanding fireballs.""

Our program will improve the SN Ia calibration for distance measurements. By determining correlations among the key parameters needed for distance fitting (light-curve width, maximum, and the explosion time) on the scale of minutes rather than days, this program will improve the precision of distances and hence the constraints on dark energy.

We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe the entire field every other day using SkyMapper, ATLAS and DECam.  We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify discovered transients using Lick, Gemini, and Keck. In Campaign C5 and C6, we successfully identified 4 SNe with DECam observations, of which we classified 2 with Gemini spectra as SN Ia.  These data, coupled with high precision 30 minute K2 data will have enormous legacy value.

Methods:
We have developed and proven a highly successful detrending method that simultaneously solves for the sawtooth pattern caused by pointing motion and for the coefficients of vectors from principal component analysis of targets on the same channel. This iterative technique permits us to define aperture sizes better suited to this problem and to make excellent corrections for sensitivity variations on all time scales.  To properly correct SN light curves, the technique is applied to the quiet time before the event and then extrapolated through to the end of the campaign.

The first of our three objectives is construct catalogs of transiting planets in the magnitude-limited samples of K2 fields.  These catalogs enable diverse follow-up observations and analyses by our team and others.  Second, we aim to discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  Our third goal is to use the planet catalogs to measure variations in the occurrence rate of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood. We already see differences between the populations of planets orbiting nearby stars and stars in the prime Kepler Field.  For example, hot Jupiters are 2.5 times less abundant in the Kepler Field (Howard et al. 2012).  We have to wonder if the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone (Petigura et al. 2013) is similarly reduced relative to nearby stars. With this proposal we will measure the occurrence of detectable, short-period super-Earths and Neptune-size planets (~2-3 Earth-radii). 

This Cycle 4 request for Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in C0-C10 (PIs Howard, Sanchis-Ojeda, Petigura, and Winn) that constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.  We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts.  Here we request magnitude-limited samples (Kp < 14) of Fields 11-13 comprising approximately 10,000 stars per field.

We will continue our search for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013).  We catalog the planets discovered, their orbital and physical properties, and their host star characteristics.  We compute the occurrence rates of small, close-in planets using injection-and-recovery tests to account for the sensitivity of TERRA and will report the field-to-field variability and overall rates of planet occurrence. Assuming a precision of 80 ppm over 6.5 hours, a 2 Earth-radii planet with P = 20-day is detectable at SNR = 8 during a single 75-day K2 campaign.  Based on the prime mission occurrence statistics, we expect to find 3 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with P < 20 days per 1,000 stars observed. As validated by our searches of K2 photometry from Campaigns 0-2, a sample of 8,000 stars is expected to yield ~25 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with orbital periods less than 20 days, providing an occurrence measurement with 25% fractional uncertainty. With 8,000 stars, we will be sensitive to factor-of-two variations in the occurrence rate of 2-3 Earth-radii planets at 4-sigma significance.  In addition, we will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES and other facilities. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultra-short-period Earths. Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission."

astrophysics, and solving this will have significant ramifications for our understanding of how other galaxies form and evolve. Success
will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution.
This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the
solar neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used
Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential
for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.
RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar
samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program
for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to
those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.
AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (on average ~5000 per campaign) to
probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to
make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys
structure and evolution from its stellar populations.
METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by
ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use

Proposal summary:
For planets that transit their host stars, we can use spectroscopy and photometry to measure planetary mass and radius. This leads to constraints on the planets' bulk compositions, internal structures, and formation and evolution histories. We discovered two transiting planet systems, WASP-28 and WASP-151, which will be on silicon during campaign 12. These systems are good targets for further study due to the moderate brightness of the host stars. We propose to observe both systems at short cadence (SC). From simulated lightcurves of each system, we predict the radii of both the star and the planet to be better determined by a factor of ~2 with SC data as compared to long-cadence data. 

We will produce high-precision lightcurves of each target star using our own proven software pipeline (Mocnik et al. 2015), which is effective in removing systematics from K2 data. We will combine the resulting lightcurves with in-hand transit photometry and radial-velocity data in a full analysis of each system to precisely determine their parameters (e.g. Anderson et al. 2015). 

WASP-28b is an inflated, Jupiter-mass planet (0.91 MJup, 1.21 RJup) in a 3.4-day orbit around a V = 12, F8 star (Anderson et al. 2015). By taking spectra through a transit, we measured the angle between the planet's orbital axis and the star's spin axis to be small (a sky projected spin-orbit angle = 8 +/- 18 deg). With such spin-orbit angle measurements for an ensemble of systems, we may discern the pathways through which hot Jupiters migrated inwards to their present orbits. During a K2 engineering test in January of 2014, WASP-28 was observed for 2.6 days in SC mode. Whilst the resulting lightcurve proved a useful early science demonstration of the fledgling K2 mission (Howell et al. 2014), a SC lightcurve with a 75-day baseline would enable us to determine the system parameters to high precision. 

We recently confirmed WASP-151b to be a hot Saturn (0.3 Mjup, 1.2 Rjup) in a 4.5-day orbit around a V = 13, G4 star. We can infer the composition of a planet's atmosphere by measuring the wavelengths of the light preferentially blocked and scattered during transit (transmission spectroscopy). Atmospheric composition is a diagnostic of planetary formation and evolution and it can combine with mass and radius measurements to break degeneracies when inferring bulk composition and internal structure. WASP-151 is a good transmission target as the predicted change in transit depth due to an annulus with a thickness of one atmospheric scale-height is large (~2%).

Data from K2's Field 3 revealed a Neptune and a super-Earth in the WASP-47 system (Becker et al. 2015), which we had already shown to contain a Jupiter. WASP-47b is currently the only hot Jupiter known to have close companions. We must search other systems if we are to measure the occurrence rate of hot Jupiters with close companions, which will be useful in understanding how such systems form. To perform an effective search for companions of WASP-28b and WASP-151b we require SC data. 

The stellar temperature of WASP-151 (5700 K) suggests the possibility of starspots. From an analysis of the times at which the planet transited starspots, which would require SC data to resolve and thus model, we may then be able to measure the spin-orbit angle of the WASP-151 system (Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2011; Nutzman et al. 2011)."

We propose the characterization of Be stars in K2 fields 11, 12 and 13. Classical Be stars are rapid rotators of spectral type B and luminosity class V-III which have an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk. The disk often exhibits Balmer emission lines and an infrared excess fed by discrete mass loss events called outbursts. In spite of their high V sin i, rapid rotation alone cannot explain
the ejection episodes as most Be stars do not rotate at their critical rotation rates. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations have been analyzed to demonstrate short-term variations are rather common among early-type Be stars. The observed line profile variability (LPV) is characterized by moving bumps traveling from blue to red across the line profile on timescales ranging from minutes to a few days. Non-radial pulsations (NRP) have been proposed as an explanation of the LPV observed in hot stars. NRP
produce LPV thanks to the combination of the Doppler displacement of stellar surface elements with their associated temperature variations due to the compression/expansion caused by the passage of waves through the photosphere. NRP could be the additional mechanism required for a rapidly rotating B star to become a Be star, that is to trigger the Be phenomenon by means of mass ejection (Rivinius et al. 1998).
2. High-precision photometry and pulsation periods.
Huat et al. (2009) found for the Be HD 49330 from CoRoT and ground-based spectroscopic data an increase in amplitude for g-modes and a decrease for p-modes just before an outburst. Neiner et al. (2012) discovered gravito-inertial modes in the Be star HD 51452. They found that the mode amplitudes were linked to the presence of mini outbursts. In general, hot Be stars display nonradial pressure pulsation modes, whereas cooler ones display gravity modes. Despite those empirical evidences, the physical processes responsible for the outbursts and mass loss in Be stars are still poorly understood. Dziembowski et al. (2007) showed that high-order g-modes driven by the kappa mechanism are unstable in the region of the HR diagram occupied by Be stars. The predicted radial velocity amplitude
due to an l=3 g-mode is ~ 20 km/s for a star with 4 solar masses, with pulsation periods in the range ~0.51.1 days. For more massive and hotter stars like HD 171219, unstable modes are found with periods of 0.5-2 days.
3. Methods and proposed targets
Pulsation analysis of a star requires the measurement of frequencies with both high photometric precision and high time-frequency resolution. Only space missions provide both conditions. Since NRP in Be stars have periods near 1.0 cycles per day, Kepler observations are especially important to avoid the frequency aliases due to the day/night cycle of ground observations. Another advantage of Kepler data is the continuous observations for months with a 30 min cadence that improves the chances to observe outburst events in our targets. Stellar seismology made a great leap forward thanks to the MOST, CoRoT and Kepler satellites.  Our targets have Kp between 4.4 and 15.7 Long cadence (30 min) is desirable for this research. We aim to have both Kepler photometric time-series and simultaneous ground spectroscopic observations in the first month of kepler observations to measure Be periodicities and understand the Be phenomenon. Our proposal fits the Small category, and the number of our targets will be under 300. Our group have experience with asteroseismology and have already worked in the same analysis with CoRoT data, and have targets been observed in K2 cycle 3.
4. Significance
Be stars, as easy-to-observe objects giving a privileged peek into the structure of rapidly rotating stars, are therefore among the best suited laboratories to investigate important problems in contemporary astrophysics, like the effects of rapid rotation on stellar evolution."

Studying these properties relies on reliable fundamental parameters of stars: their masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities. Eclipsing binary stars lend themselves naturally to this task, since their favorable geometrical orientation and basic laws of gravity enable us to determine fundamental parameters to a ~1% accuracy. We scoured the published catalogs and proprietary KELT and SuperWASP data for all eclipsing binary stars in K2 C11, C12 and C13 fields. We propose to observe these stars and, along with other serendipitous discoveries of binarity in the fields, build a stellar population model based on the fundamental parameters derived from K2 data and follow-up multi-color photometry and spectroscopy.

underlying physics which produce flares. A second key goal is to assess how correlated flares are with the stellar rotational phase. Kepler observations indicate that at least some flare stars do not show a correlation but do show a characteristic rotational modulation. This is difficult to explain since the modulation is expected to be due to starspots rotating into and out of view which should produce a correlation between phase and flare rate. Our work will also have implications for determining how flares can effect the atmosphere of any exoplanets in the stellar system. Our target selection will cover the M (and early L) spectral types. We bid for observatios of 4, 3 and 10 known flare stars in Fields 11, 12 and 13 respectively.

Mass accretion from the circumstellar disk onto the star is a fundamental process in the formation of Sun-like stars. Accretion is inherently time variable, and its fluctuations are responsible for an significant fraction of photometric variations observed in young stars (Herbst et al. 1994). Accretion rates show a wide variety in different young stellar objects. EX Lup- and FU Ori-type variable stars (EXors and FUors, collectively called young eruptive stars) exhibit the most extreme accretion rate changes, up to several orders of magnitude, appearing as 1-5 mag optical outbursts. There are also other low-mass young T Tauri stars where accretion significantly exceeds the average rate.

The aim of this proposal is to study the mass accretion in the time domain in a sample of actively accreting young stars in the benchmark star-forming region Taurus. The accretion rate variations will be deduced from the observed flux fluctuations, derived from high cadence, high accuracy K2 photometry.  Beside analyzing the general variability characteristics and patterns, we will also study two so-far little understood phenomena related to the accretion process: flickering and periodic accretion signal variations.

Flickering is small amplitude (0.01-1.0 mag) random fluctuations on timescales of 1 day or less, observed in young eruptive stars (Kenyon et al. 2000), originating in a region between the central star and disk. During FUor outbursts, a large amount of disk material falls to the stellar surface, therefore, flickering will provide information on the inhomogeneity of the accretion flow (e.g., Bastien et al. 2011). Similar short-term variations were found in classical T Tauri stars as well (BP Tau, Gullbring et al. 1996; DG Tau, DR Tau, and DI Cep, Hessman  & Guenther 1997). These variations are interpreted with a magnetospheric disk model, where jitter in the magnetically channeled flow from the inner disk to the star produces small amplitude flares. The proposed K2 observations will constitute the highest time resolution and sensitivity study of this phenomenon.

Accretion-related periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations were detected in the outburst light curves of many young eruptive stars. EX Lup, the prototype of EXors, showed fluctuations with increasing amplitude and 35 d period during its outburst in 2008 (Juhasz et al. 2012); V960 Mon showed oscillations with declining amplitude and period of 17 d, explained by a hypothetical eccentric close binary (Hackstein et al. 2015); V1647 Ori displayed 56 d period in the light curve, probably due to obscuration by an orbiting dust cloud (Acosta-Pulido et al. 2007); and HBC 722 showed 5.8 and 1.28 d periods, the first associated to stellar rotation, the second one to disk instability and flickering (Green et al. 2013). These examples demonstrate that photometric monitoring and period analysis are powerful tools for identifying various processes that modulate the usually assumed simple, steady accretion flow. The 80 d observing window of K2 is most appropriate for covering the expected periodicities.

Using K2 in long cadence mode, we will monitor brightness variations in eight EXors, FUors, and other highly accreting systems, in order to determine typical variability timescales, patterns, and amplitudes."
GO13006,13,Niall,R,Deacon,University of Hertfordshire,nialldeacon@hotmail.com,"Kraus, Adam L; Mann, Andrew Withycombe",The effect of wide binaries on planet occurrence - K2 Campaigns 12 and 13,"We plan to observe a sample of wide binaries spread across the K2 fields to constrain the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence and to provide benchmark systems for gyrochronology.

Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence. Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100 AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013).  In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star. In Deacon et al. (2016) we showed that wide binarity does not affect the occurrence rate of P<300 day planets around FGK stars. We plan to expand this to M dwarfs using K2 data. Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity. Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars. 

Science Goal 2: Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components. 

We have used the proper motion catalogue produced by Kraus et al. (2014) based on the methods of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007) including proper motions, estimated spectral types and distance moduli from SED fitting. We have selected objects with significant (>5 sigma) proper motions above 30 mas/yr. From these we selected pairs of widely separated objects with common proper motion and distance.  To remove contamination due to coincident pairings of unrelated field stars, we plotted a histogram of pair separations similar to the one we constructed for previous fields. From this we will select pairs which lie in the region dominated by true physical pairs. Field 11's low latitude means that the coincident pairing rate is too high to select any true common proper motion binaries, but field 12 and 13 are rich with identifiable wide binary systems."
GO13007,13,Steven,,Kawaler,Iowa State University,sdk@iastate.edu,,Search for rotational modulation in precise photometry of white dwarf stars,"This program will use very sensitive photometric observations of known white dwarfs by K2 during Campaigns 12, and 13 to search for rotational modulation of the flux from white dwarf stars.  These photometric variations can be caused by processes such as magnetic phenomena (such as starspots and plages) or large-scale granulation caused by convection. On the expected white dwarf rotation periods (about 1 day, generalizing from nonradially pulsating white dwarfs), the low amplitude of the expected variations renders them extremely difficult to detect using ground-based photometry. Measurement of rotation modulation (or even upper limits to photometric amplitude variations) will further exploit those data to teach us about magnetic fields and other processes in these stars that are otherwise inaccessible observationally.  

These new targets will build on results from observations in earlier K2 campaigns, allowing a statistically meaningful assessment of white dwarf rotation as an indicator of angular momentum transport during earlier phases of evolution.

In the nonradially pulsating white dwarfs, we can independently measure the rotation rate, providing a test of asteroseismic rotation periods."

Planets evolve as a result of accretion, atmospheric escape, cooling, and gravitational interactions with companion stars or other planets. By studying planets over a range of ages it is possible to infer the effect of these processes, including the timescales over which they operate and their relative importance on the final planetary system architecture. However, the vast majority of planetary systems, including those discovered by the Kepler and K2 missions are much older (Gyr) than the timescales of interest (Myr to hundreds of Myr) and/or have poorly or completely unconstrained ages. Thus they provide little insight on planetary evolution. K2 is observing star-forming regions and young stellar clusters with ages of 1-850 million years.  Of these, Hyades is the closest (45 parsecs) and hence its members brightest, facilitating the discovery of planets, especially around the lowest-mass members. In Campaign 4, K2 observed the edge of the Hyades cluster. However, because only a small part of the cluster was within the field of view, the observed sample was relatively small and thus far we have identified only a single exoplanet. During Campaign 13, K2 will point directly at the core of the Hyades, observing many more member stars.  This larger dataset will provide many more targets for detailed follow-up and facilitate a comparison between the properties of young and old planets. We propose K2 observations of 200 late-type (late K and M) dwarfs that are confirmed or candidate members of the Hyades and fall on K2 silicon in Campaign 13.  In addition to established members from the literature we have constructed a sample of high probability members based on their photometry and proper motions. We have already built a transit-search pipeline optimized for the fast rotating and highly variable young stars, which we have successfully employed on K2 observations in Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe. Once candidates are identified we will carry out follow-up observations to estimate the fundamental stellar parameters of these stars, assess their membership to the Hyades cluster, and where possible, constrain the mass and orbital alignment of the planet."

The entire Taurus complex consists of more than 400 comoving members with ages of 0-3 Myr, with ~75% of the solar-type members hosting a gaseous primordial circumstellar disk. Taurus is one of the nearest northern star-forming regions (d=145 pc) and has a relatively low stellar density even in the centers of filaments (<10 per cubic parsec, e.g. Kraus & Hillenbrand 2009). K2 campaign 13 will directly target a large fraction of the Taurus region, making campaign 13 the richest campaign in terms of newly formed stars around which to search for planets.

The K2 mission is ideal for measuring planet formation timescales and migration pathways. Over the past 10 campaigns, multiple groups of young stars have been observed by K2, ranging from the 10 Myr old Upper Scorpius OB association, through the ~120 Myr old Pleiades, and the ~600 Myr old Hyades moving group. The detected, and soon to be detected exoplanets in these samples of different age will reveal the evolution of the exoplanet population in the early stages of stellar life. The 0-3 Myr old Taurus star-forming region will be a critical youngest-age sample in the forming picture of exoplanet population evolution. The detection, or absence of transiting exoplanets at the age of Taurus will place strong constraints of the timescales of exoplanet formation and migration.

We propose to use K2 in campaign 13, in long-cadence mode, to search confirmed and probable Taurus members for the youngest known transiting exoplanets. We have already developed tools, which we have applied to existing data, to extract lightcurves from K2 data and remove instrumental systematics. We have also developed methods for removing stellar activity signals from the lightcurves of young stars, and have identified candidate transiting exoplanets in the K2 Upper Scorpius data from campaign 2. We will extend these techniques for analysis of the Taurus data taken in campaign 13. We have planned a robust follow-up campaign for any detected Taurus planets, utilizing a full suite of techniques including multi-band ground based photometry to confirm the planetary nature of the transits, and high-resolution imaging and IR spectroscopy to detect stellar companions.

We also expect to discover ~5 eclipsing binary systems in the proposed sample, which, with ground based follow-up, will offer revolutionary constraints at the youngest reaches of the pre-main sequence evolutionary models. We are already following up 10 eclipsing binaries in Upper Scorpius from K2 campaign 2, and a further 20 in older nearby clusters. We will add any new eclipsing binaries in Taurus to this program.

We have built a complete census of confirmed Taurus members from all of the existing literature and our own spectroscopic confirmation, and have supplemented this with a kinematic search for high confidence candidate new members (following the method of Rizzuto et al. 2011,2015). In total, we propose to observe 445 targets with 9<Kp<19 that fall on K2 silicon, 235 confirmed members, and 210 candidate new members selected on the basis of their kinematics and photometry. Our targets list is the most complete sample of Taurus stars ever compiled."

Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy.

Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012). For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission.

The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars.

Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem.

Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013).

Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. Several hundred of them (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields from 2014 to 2017. We have successfully applied for time in previous campaigns and the lightcurves for campaigns 0-5 are fully analysed, paper close to submission (Stelzer et al., A&A). For fields 11-13, observed in late 2016 and early 2017, we propose to include ~100 targets in the K2 fields for these campaigns for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them will fall onto the Kepler chips. For the subsequent fields we will submit similarly sized numbers of objects. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner using the procedures developed for previous campaigns."
GO13011,13,Aleks,,Scholz,University of St Andrews,as110@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Kostov, Veselin; Stelzer, Beate; Jayawardhana, Ray; Melnikov, Stanislav; Eisloeffel, Jochen",Rotation and activity of brown dwarfs in Taurus,"Rotation is a fundamental parameter in the formation and evolution of stars. Young stars have orders of magnitude less angular momentum per unit mass than the cloud cores from which they have formed, indicating that efficient rotational braking occurs in the first few million years, due to binary and planet formation as well as interaction between star and disk. Subsequently stars spin up due to pre-main sequence contraction over ~100 million years. On longer timescales, the spin of stars is controlled by winds powered by stellar magnetic fields. Thus, the rotation is linked to key elements in the evolution of stars. 

In contrast to most other parameters of low-mass stars, the rotation period is a quantity that can be measured with very high accuracy in many objects. Period measurements are routinely done by photometric monitoring and measuring the periodic flux modulation caused by cool magnetic spots co-rotating with the stars. The rotation periods provide highly relevant constraints on our understanding of magnetic activity and angular momentum exchange between stars and their disks. For comprehensive reviews on this topic, see Herbst et al. (2007) and Bouvier et al. (2014).

For FGK stars, our best spindown models succesfully reproduce the observed periods in open clusters with known age and distance. These models take into account disk locking, contraction, wind braking, as well as core-envelope decoupling. So far, however, the models fail to explain the rotational evolution of the fully convective very low mass stars (M<0.3 Msol) and brown dwarfs (M<0.08 Msol). Over the past decade, we have carried out groundbreaking observational work to characterise the rotational behaviour of these VLM objects. In a series of papers we have published more than hundred rotation periods for objects below the 0.3 Msol boundary (Scholz & Eisloeffel 2004a, b, 2005, 2007; Scholz, Eisloeffel, Mundt 2009; Scholz et al. 2011). It has turned out that VLM objects retain high rotation rates for at least a gigayear, brown dwarfs for much longer. This is puzzling, as there is also evidence for large-scale magnetic fields and strong magnetic activity in VLM stars (Morin et al. 2011). The fast rotation of VLM objects may be a result of inefficient angular momentum transport due to a change in magnetic field topology and/or the increasingly neutral stellar atmospheres. At this point, however, this remains speculative.

The current rotational database is very sparse in the mass domain below 0.3 Msol, which precludes further empirical tests of the ideas outlined above. Almost no periods are available for objects with M<0.1Msol and ages >10 Myr. Most periods for young brown dwarfs are in distant regions with little chance of detailed follow-up. K2 offers a unique chance to remedy the situation and to study the rotation of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs as a function of age. We have already published the first brown dwarf rotation period from campaign 2 for the 10 Myr old UpSco association (Scholz et al. 2015). We are currently in the process of analysing data from campaign 4 and 5, which contain The field covers large parts of the Pleiades (age 100 Myr), the Hyades (age 600 Myr), and Praesepe (age 600 Myr), three of the classical benchmark clusters. In addition, a paper with rotation periods and activity diagnostics for field M dwarfs from campaign 0-4 is close to being submitted (Stelzer et al. 2016). In campaign 13 we get another chance to pursue this project, when the K2 field includes the young brown dwarfs in the Taurus association (age 1-2 Myr), and again the Hyades, in total about 100 target for our science goals. Here we propose to study their rotation and activity using K2 and to continue our successful project."

This will be achieved using short-cadence (SC) data collected during K2 Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 (C11-13). The information contained in solar-like oscillations allows the internal stellar structure to be constrained to unprecedented levels, and allows precise determinations of fundamental stellar properties (e.g., mass, radius, and age). We seek to exploit the unique opportunity offered by K2 to observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed during the nominal mission, thus benefiting from better independent constraints (from, e.g., parallaxes, spectroscopy, interferometry, etc.). This will make it possible to bring the full potential of asteroseismology to bear to test the physics of stellar interiors. To constrain our analysis further we plan for a spectroscopic follow-up of the proposed targets. By combining the targets observed during C11-13 with those from previous K2 campaigns that possess independent constraints we may calibrate seismic scaling relations. This will be essential in seismic galactic archaeology studies, which rely on the application of these relations. Including also targets from the nominal mission, we may study the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood and place constraints on the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars. The results will be used in ongoing investigations that are relevant to this solicitation:
-In C13 we propose to observe several members of the Hyades open cluster, where we intend to obtain independent constraints from interferometry with CHARA, and for the brightest targets simultaneous RV observation with the SONG telescope network. We have successfully detected solar-like oscillations in two Hyades stars observed during C4; adding to this with targets from C13 with independent constraints will greatly help our ongoing analysis of the Hyades.
-The targets will further expand the sample of benchmark stars having precise fundamental properties from asteroseismology to different fields in the Galaxy, which will be crucial to calibrate upcoming large surveys such as Gaia and GALAH. The use of results from our asteroseismic analysis of targets from C1-3 have already been requested by the Gaia-ESO team to help calibrate their astrophysical parameters data reduction pipeline.
-The availability of precise asteroseismic ages of stars with detectable surface rotation periods will provide additional constraints for gyrochronology.
-Asteroseismology will allow us to better characterize targets with detected exoplanets, including both new detections made by K2 and known exoplanet-host stars on our list.

We estimate requesting for 40-50 targets per campaign. These should show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes, hence SC data are required for detecting the oscillations. We will prepare analysis-ready light curves from pixel-data using in-house software - these will be made available to the community via the KASOC portal. Next, we will apply well-tested analysis procedures to the frequency-power spectra of the light curves, providing both estimates of global seismic parameters and parameters describing individual modes of oscillation. Detailed frequency modelling using state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes will then provide the stellar properties. The methodology delineated above has already been successfully applied to the analysis of K2 C1-5 data, for which we reached a very good understanding of the asteroseismic detection yield. From C3-5 data we have found that solar-like oscillations can be detected for stars similar to the Sun, with characteristic frequencies around 3100 micro Hertz. We have also successfully extracted individual frequencies for these stars, hence enabling detailed seismic modelling."
GO13014,13,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,"Rotation rates and ages of stars in wide binary systems, and a search for hierarchical triples in Kepler K2 campaigns 11-12-13","Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and presumably have very similar chemical compositions. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated, which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are. Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 11, 12, and 13, we have identified a total of 180 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 60. Our statistical analysis indicates that about 90% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignment of unrelated stars). Half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. A majority of the secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, many pairs can be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target (or may use fewer pixels overall). One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, which means that a significant fraction of wide binaries may actually be hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or eclipsing) binary star; this prediction will be directly tested with K2, by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries in those pairs."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is known about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. Our astrometric and photometric analysis of the fields to be observed by K2 in campaigns 11, 12, and 13 identifies 2,604 high-velocity subdwarfs that are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, in order to identify and characterize the first generations of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits, following the methodologies developed in the first Kepler mission. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based, follow-up observations to confirm the existence of the transit, and determine if it is from a planet of from a stellar companion. The detection of eclipsing stellar companions would also be of high interest for stellar astrophysics, as it would provide natural calibrators of the mass-radius relationship; while this relationship is critical to constrain models of stellar structure, such calibrators currently do not exist for low-mass, metal-poor stars. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will be complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."

However, many steps in this transformation are obscure and we especially need information at the scale of <~1 AU, where we know most about the planet population, but which is unresolved even by the ALMA interferometric array.  Precision time-domain photometry by space-based missions such as K2 over intervals corresponding to the orbital periods at these scales (hours to months) is an alternative approach.  Photometric variability of T Tauri stars is thought to be related to changes in disk accretion, magnetic activity or obscuration of the central star by dusty structures in the inner disk.  Continuous monitoring of the Orion Nebula, rho Ophiucus, and Upper Scorpius star-forming regions by CoRoT, Spitzer, and K2 have revealed a new class of variability; episodic and aperiodic drops or ""dips"" in flux of up to 30-40%  lasting hours to days.  The exact mechanism(s) behind these events is unknown but the depth, shape, and aperiodicity of these events are inconsistent with planetary transits.  Instead, dips seem related to the presence of a disk:  all K2-detected dipper stars in the rho Oph and Upper Sco clusters have infrared emission indicative of a disk, and the depth of dips is correlated with the emission from the inner disk.  Possible explanations include warps in the disk from stable accretion columns, vortices produced by a Rossby wave instability, planetesimal ""clumps"", or massive comet-like objects.  The relation of this phenomenon to an early stage of planet formation can be investigated through statistical studies of dipper populations in star-forming regions of different ages as well as the relationships between the properties of the dips and those of the disk or central star.  We propose long-cadence K2 observations in Campaign 13 of young stars in the Taurus Molecular Cloud (1-3 Myr) to identify dipper stars.   Taurus will fill in an evolutionary sequence from the Orion Nebula (<~1 Myr) to Upper Sco (~10 Myr) and is at the low stellar density end of the spectrum of star-forming environments.  Our target catalog is a a composite of infrared- (WISE/Spitzer), near UV- (GALEX) and X-ray-selected (ROSAT/XMM-Newton) Taurus members, checked for proper motions that are consistent with the TMC, and all brighter than 19th magnitude.  We will generate K2 lightcurves from the pixel-level data, correct for systematics, identify and remove rotational and other long-term variability and apply an algorithm to detect dips.  We will establish the occurrence of dippers and compare theses to the rates determined for other star-forming regions.  We will obtain visible and near-infrared spectra of dipper stars to characterize the central star.  We will obtain adaptive optics imaging and high-resolution near-infrared spectra to identify any stellar companions.  We will identify any spectroscopic signatures of accretion from a gaseous disk and measure the flux at submillimeter wavelengths to estimate disk dust masses.  Our study will address three questions that are key to understanding the dipper phenomenon: (1) Do dips represent a universal process among young stars regardless of environment, e.g. lower stellar densities than in other regions such as the Orion Nebula Cluster? (2) Does the correlation between dip depth and infrared excess hold for TMC members? (3) Is there any connection between disk accretion and dips?  K2 observations and ground-based follow-up will provide new and complementary information that improves our understanding of the evolution of protoplanetary disks, one of which spawned our world, a process which presumably also governs the occurrence and distribution of habitable planets and thus life elsewhere in the Cosmos."

Low-mass M dwarfs provide the highest probability of detecting small (<0.5  4 R_E) transiting
planets by virtue of the large transit depths seen for such small stars. These deep transits also
increase the potential for subsequent atmospheric characterization. The extended Kepler K2 mission
provides the opportunity to monitor tens-of-thousands of nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise,
long-cadence photometry and discover a new population of rocky and potentially habitable planets
and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit spectroscopy. We propose to observe several
thousand additional M dwarfs in the K2 campaigns 1113 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our
successful K2 program that we call the K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate dozens to
hundreds of small planets around late-type stars from the full K2-MDP program. This
new population of planets will drastically increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems,
improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and
atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected from the SUPERBLINK proper-motion database on the basis of
high proper-motion and photometric colors. This selection method captures the majority of M dwarfs
within 100pc of the Sun from this deep (95% complete to V =19) catalog with little contamination.
Our targets have median brightness Kp<16, most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC.
We prioritize our targets using expected transit S/N, determined by comparing K2s photometric
precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting super-Earth. We estimate transit
depths by converting DSS, PanSTARRS 1, 2MASS, and WISE photometry to spectral type and
then to radius and temperature. Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light
curves to search K2 pixel data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate
planet hosts will provide fundamental parameters such as temperature, metallicity, surface gravity,
and age. Where feasible, new systems will be proposed as targets for radial velocity monitoring
for full characterization. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host
characterization, aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf
planets to date. The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward these goals and
draws on considerable experience from Kepler. We have so far had successful target
proposals in all previous K2 fields, have been awarded large, multisemester programs
at ESO (for spectroscopic follow-up), Keck (for Radial Velocity masses), and Gemini
(for AO and speckle imaging).


Relevance

The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims
to exploit the strengths of the K2 mission design to reveal hundreds of small planets
around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-like planets and planets
suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky planets and key transit
spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) leading up
to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; well before the launch of TESS.

Our goals are to discover pulsating variable stars, as well as eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars with variability produced by rotating spots or flares, and develop statistics on the occurrence of variability.  This proposal complements observations taken for our previous K2 GO Cycle 1, 2, and 3 proposals, as each K2 field samples different stellar populations in the Galactic disk, halo, spiral arms, and young clusters near the ecliptic plane.  We use B-V and J-K colors and magnitudes in the EPIC catalog to select main-sequence stars with Kepler magnitudes between 6 and 16.  The Kepler signal-to-noise level is high enough to identify variability in even the faintest proposed targets, and many of these stars will be bright enough for ground-based follow-up observations, including high-resolution spectroscopic observations for pulsation mode identification.  The survey will also be useful to identify promising targets for current or future space-based observations by, e.g., TESS, PLATO, or BRITE.

Observations by the Kepler spacecraft have turned out to be ideal for discovery and characterization of main-sequence stars pulsating in radial and nonradial pressure and gravity modes. The long time series and high precision of the photometry have enabled determination of frequencies of modes with periods of order a day (g modes) to a few hours (p and mixed modes), and amplitudes as low as tens of parts per million using long-cadence data (30-min integrations per data point). Analysis of the Kepler data has raised a number of questions about the possible pulsation driving mechanisms for gamma Doradus g-mode and delta Scuti p-mode pulsations, and revealed an unexpectedly large number of hybrid star candidates that show pulsations in both types of modes. The Kepler data have also been used to study slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars (g-mode pulsators), beta Cephei stars (p-mode pulsators) and their hybrids to test stellar pulsation theory in the presumably simpler case for these hotter stars with smaller inefficient envelope convection zones. The analysis has also revealed a number of apparently non-pulsating stars that lie within the pulsation instability regions established by theory that need to be explained. We expect to increase the numbers of these types of stars available for detailed study, especially for candidates brighter than those found in the original Kepler field. We also expect to discover additional eclipsing binaries and magnetically active stars. 

Our sample selection is not biased toward known pulsators, and includes enough stars to derive statistics on the occurrence of variability.  We will compare our results with similar surveys of stars in the original Kepler Cygnus-Lyra field as well as K2 Fields 6, 8, and 10, and with surveys of stars in open clusters for K2 Fields 0, 4, 5, and 7.  We will also extend the time series of observations for some Hyades cluster stars observed in the K2 Field 4 that are also observable in Field 13.  We will produce a catalog of the candidate variables, eclipsing binaries, and magnetically active stars that we find.

Although we are proposing to observe several thousand targets (large proposal), our budget request will be $50K (small-proposal limit) for the PI to oversee the project, prepare the catalog, and present results in journal papers and at conferences."
GO13021,13,Kathleen,E,Kraemer,Boston College,kathleen.kraemer@bc.edu,"Sloan, Gregory C",Fundamental Properties of Galactic Carbon Stars from K2 Observations,"We propose to observe 29 evolved carbon stars that are in the upcoming K2 fields F11, F12, and F13. Carbon stars may be responsible for at least half the dust returned to the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) (e.g., Jura & Kleinmann 1989, Gehrz 1989). However, while progress has recently been made linking the dust production and mass loss of these stars to their long-term pulsations, little is known about their high-frequency oscillations. Most of the work so far has concentrated on the oxygen-rich sample of evolved stars (e.g., Banyai et al. 2013, 2014). To fill this void, we will use K2 to observe the evolved carbon stars in the next three campaigns. K2 enables us to to bypass a basic problem in Galactic astronomy: the unknown distances to Galactic carbon stars. With K2 data, the asteroseismologic techniques and models that have been developed for oxygen-rich stars (e.g., Chaplin & Miglio 2013) can be applied to the carbon stars in order to determine their fundamental parameters like mass, radius, and surface gravity - independent of their unknown distances. Thus, a small investment of K2 time, 29 long-cadence observations, has the potential for a very high
scientific payoff."
GO13022,13,Philip,Steven,Muirhead,Boston University,philipm@bu.edu,"Skinner, Julie N; Croll, Bryce",Activity and Planets at the Bottom of the Main-Sequence,"We propose to observe a carefully selected sample of ultra-cool dwarfs (UCDs) with K2 during Campaigns 11, 12 and 13. UCDs occupy the transition from main-sequence stars to brown dwarfs (late-M and later) and are essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the lowest mass objects in the Universe. Historically, photometric monitoring of UCDs for transiting planets and rotational spot modulation has been hampered by their intrinsic faintness and the expected short duration of transit events. The K2 spacecraft provides an excellent opportunity to study these objects in more detail, thanks to the large aperture and near-continuous 80-day photometric coverage of each K2 field. 

Searching for Transiting Planets Orbiting UCDs: The discovery of a transiting-planet orbiting a UCD would having significant implications for the field of exoplanets. UCDs are small, all roughly the diameter of Jupiter, which implies deep fractional transit signatures. UCDs are also relatively bright in the infrared. A planet that transits a UCD, whether gaseous or rocky, would be an ideal target for near-infrared transit transmission spectroscopy, as has been successfully performed on super Earths orbiting mid-M dwarf stars with the Hubble Space Telescope. Future transit transmission observations with NASAs James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets, but only for those planets that transit ultra-cool dwarfs. The transits from rocky planets orbiting mid-M dwarf stars and earlier are simply not deep enough to search for biosignatures over the expected lifetime of JWST. Recent studies of short-period planet occurrence around early and mid M dwarfs show that lower mass stars have significantly more rocky short-period planets than Sun-like stars. Extrapolating to ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect a large fraction, if not all UCDs to harbor rocky planets with transit probabilities of ~10%. 

Spot morphology at the M/L transition: Studies indicate that over 90% of UCDs show evidence of surface activity in the form of H± emission; however, the nature of the activity is not fully understood. Unlike sun-like stars, UCDs have fully convective interiors and are expected to have magnetic field morphologies markedly different from the Sun. With precise photometric monitoring of UCDs with K2 we will measure the morphology of spots on the surfaces of UCDs via light curve inversion. We will also search for flare events and correlate those flare events to specific spots structures. 

Surface activity in UCDs is related to stellar wind and ultraviolet emission from their chromospheres, both of which affect the photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets. Understanding the nature of surface activity on UCDs is therefore critical for interpreting transit-transmission spectroscopy, as well as inferring the habitability of any detected planets. K2 provides a unique opportunity to study ultra-cool dwarfs in a way never before realized."

We will use these data to: (a) search for close-in gas giant planets orbiting members of the Hyades (and hence determine if being born in a dense environment affects the planet formation process); (b) identify eclipsing binary stars among the Hyades members, thereby providing new precision tests of stellar evolution models; and (c) determine properties of these stars related to their youth (spottedness, rotation period, flaring frequency) better than can be done from ground based observations.  By combining these data with similar data we have obtained for the Pleiades, M35, and Praesepe during the K2 field 4 and 5 campaigns, and with data we obtained with CoRoT for the 2 Myr old NGC 2264 open cluster, we will address how these properties evolve with time and as a function of stellar mass. A small number of Hyades members were included in the K2 Field 4 campaign - we will add the data for those stars to those we obtain for Field 13.  Our group has already identified one Hyades planet in the C4 data (David et al 2016, in press). The results from this program would add significantly to our knowledge of the origin and evolution of stars, thereby directly addressing one of the primary NASA astrophysics goals.   

We will use the same methodologies to analyze the new Hyades data that we have employed for our Fields 4 and 5 data (e.g., David et al. 2016 in press, David et al. 2015, Rebull et al. 2016 in prep, Stauffer et al. 2016 in prep).  Our team includes several  people who have developed their own K2 photometry and detrending packages.   We will therefore derive our own light curves from the raw K2 data, and use the K2-provided PDC light curves as the starting point in our analysis.  Our team also includes experts in the detection and characterization of eclipsing binaries and transiting planets (David et al. 2016 in press, David et al. 2015), as well as experts on open clusters in general and the Hyades in particular.  Finally, several team members have been involved for two decades or more in programs aimed at determining the angular momentum evolution of low mass stars and in measuring the rotational velocities of low mass stars - we will apply the same techniques developed by us for those past programs to analyze the new K2 data."

A major result from surveys for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars.  This trend is not seen, however, around super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al 2014).  We propose to search a large sample of sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] < 0.0) stars in the fields of K2 GO Cycle 4 Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 for transiting planets of all sizes.  Stars in this metallicity range fall into three populations: a) the thin-disk (which also extends into super-solar metallicity), b) the thick-disk, and c) the halo (which extends to extremely metal poor stars). These three populations differ both kinematically and chemically.  Thick disk stars exhibit a larger vertical scale height in the galactic orbits, and they also show alpha-capture element abundances enhanced by about a factor of two over thin-disk stars.  Halo stars show even more extreme kinematics and also exhibit significant enhancement of alpha-capture elements.  The discovery of the Kepler-444 system (Campante et al 2015), which comprises five sub-Earth size planets orbiting an ancient (11.2 Gy age) thick-disk star with significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe=H]=-0.69 +/- 0.09 dex) shows that planet formation started very early in the history of the galaxy.  We will compute planet occurrence rates for stars as a function of stellar metallicity, stellar population and of planet radius.  For stellar metallicity, we will consider not just the standard [Fe/H] abundance, but also the abundance of the very important alpha-capture elements.  The goal of our program is to determine the characteristics of the first stars in our Galaxy to form potentially habitable planetary systems.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W.  Cochran), the European KEST consortium (represented in this proposal by Dr. M. Fridlund),  and at KASI (led by Dr.  B.-C. Lee) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.  and will perform Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.

Targets:
We will propose a large sample of approximately 3000 targets.  They range in V magnitude from about 5 to 13, with most of the targets in the range 10 < V < 12.  Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2015, MNRAS, 247, 2880) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 80 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems. These results will provide important new constraints on the physics and chemistry of planetary system formation, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."

This is a continuation of Program GO7057 that was accepted for K2 campaigns 6 & 7 (8 targets).

Looking for planetary systems around young stars with Kepler is a compelling approach to provide constraints on the migration mechanisms and their timescales (Lloyd et al. 2013, arXiv, 1309.1520). In particular, for hot Jupiters, it would allow discriminating between migration during formation within the protoplanetary disk (e.g. Alibert et al. 2004, A&A, 417, 25) and migration through tidal interactions (e.g. Rasio & Ford 1996, Science, 274, 954) that occur on much longer timescales (>500 Myr). For our targets, K2 will provide unprecedented access to the innermost orbital regions around these stars, allowing the identification of small planet candidates within 0.3 AU. The direct imaging follow-up at high-contrast and high-angular resolution with VLT/SPHERE will not only decrease the probability of astrophysical false-positives by background objects to extremely low levels, but it will also complete the picture of these systems in the 5-50 AU range thanks to its unique sensitivity to young giant planets. In addition, some of our targets are also part of a long-term, high-precision radial velocity monitoring with HARPS at the ESO 3.6 m telescope in La Silla, which will allow bridging the gap between the K2 and SPHERE observations.

Any joint detection of a planetary system with K2 and SPHERE would be a major discovery and consti- tute a ""Rosetta stone"" system for the study and understanding of migration processes and interactions in planetary systems. This is a central question for systems with giant planets at wide orbital separation, for which the far out location could be the result of migration through gravitational interactions with other planets in the system.

In addition, photometric monitoring is of particular interest for our young targets to determine the rotational period and deduce a gyro-chronological age. The age is an essential parameter for directly-imaged companions, and any additional constraints for the age determination will be an important addition for the SPHERE observations.

In summary, we want to look for young planetary systems using two powerful exoplanet-hunting instruments, K2 and VLT/SPHERE. We propose to observe 6 stars with ages <600 Myr that will fall into the K2 Fields #11 and #13. All but one have late spectral types and a Kepler magnitude Kp<11."
GO13026,13,Elme,,Breedt,University of Warwick,E.Breedt@warwick.ac.uk,,Accretion disc variability in Cataclysmic Variables,"Accretion discs are a common occurrence in the universe. They exist on physical scales spanning orders of magnitude, ranging from the parsec scale discs which power active galactic nuclei to protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (few thousand km). The flow of material and angular momentum through these discs are governed by the same underlying physical processes, but timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion discs around cataclysmic variables (CVs) are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure and the effects of accretion rate variations, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Continuing our programme from campaigns 0 to 10, we propose to monitor the CVs and X-ray binaries in the K2 fields with the aim of building a library of high quality light curves that can be used to investigate disc-based phenomena. CVs and other accreting compact objects display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days). The unique capability of Kepler/K2 to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is key to understand accretion and accretion variability over such a wide range of timescales."

The small size of a white dwarf (WD) star (approx. 1 Earth radii) implies that any sub-stellar or gas giant companion at suitable orbital inclination will completely eclipse it, while terrestrial bodies smaller than the Moon, including asteroids, will still produce transits that are detectable in high signal/noise light-curves.

Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approx. 25% at circa 1Gyr, Zuckerman et al.2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.

The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically significant (500 to 1000) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a significant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).

A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al.(2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al.(2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD?

This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery. 

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm(5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 1, 222  and 22 WDs (campaigns 11, 12 and 13), that have been spectroscopically identified or are deemed to have a 90% or greater probability of being a WD (Fusillo et al. 2015), and which are brighter than Kepler Magnitude 19.5 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues."

The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars need to be rotating slower than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 210 days. 

The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that many, but by no means all, Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars. 

Currently there are only three A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-57b). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars. 

Using Kepler and K2, we have a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to: 
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binarity within the Am stars, 
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars. 

Only 15 Am stars were observed during the Kepler mission, with a further 83 observed during earlier K2 Campaigns. For this proposal we have 52 targets for Campaigns 11 to 13. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to 150. 

The proposal team are experienced in the reduction of Kepler data using PyKE tools and in the analysis of time-varying photometry. We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary. 

The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."
GO13029,13,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,bod21@cam.ac.uk,,Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types cooler than M5, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such an exoplanet has not been discovered yet. As of today, K2 is the only facility that provides the required stability and photometric precision to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0 through 10 observations.

SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.

High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).

RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.

METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 11, 12 and 13, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series. The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on existing K2 data and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program.

EXPECTED YIELD. Our target list encompasses 84 M6-L6 targets. We statistically expect to detect 1 to 2 planets in this specific sample.

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes and photometry, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? In order to answer this question, we need to understand their multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates.  

The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above. Because of the limited precision on the ground based observations to measure rotation periods, we propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates. In K2 fields 11, 12 and 13, we will observe ten nearby systems, including three K and seven M dwarfs. One of the systems, GJ0176, has a known planet and the other, GJ1286, is the closest star among all three campaigns. We expect to have the most complete characterization of a set of the nearest K and M stars in all K2 fields that have ever been accomplished."
GO13033,13,Aaron,,Golden,Albert Einstein College of Medicine,aaron.golden@einstein.yu.edu,,Serendipitous Observations of Short Period Comets by K2,"Despite the detection and orbital characterization of several hundred short period comets to date, only a very small number have had their rotational properties fully determined. This is principally a consequence of their intrinsic faintness for the majority of their orbits, and the acute difficulty in securing long baseline and consistently accurate observations on the largest of ground based optical/IR telescopes to sufficiently sample ~ 4 to 40 hour periods (the approximate range of the currently known sample for which rotational data exists). The K2 mission however offers an ideal platform to study any sufficiently bright short period comets that serendipitously pass through each of the planned Cycle 4 Campaign fields - K2's unparalleled photometric sensitivity combined with its ~ 70 day observational baseline represents a unique observational opportunity to study these mysterious and compelling objects. Using both the K2ephem tool and JPL's HORIZON facility, we identified 15 short period comets that pass within the campaign fields with predicted magnitudes < 22 - 13 are Jupiter Family Comets (JFC), one is a Main Belt Comet (MBC) and one is a Centaur. Of the 11 located > 3 AU (including the MBC/`active asteroid' 176P/LINEAR), K2's  precision photometry will allow us to accurately characterize their nucleus rotation periods. For the remaining 4 comets within 3 AU that are expected to be active, full coverage of their passage across K2's field of view will yield a unique temporal profile of nucleus activity, in addition to a rotational period. These data will be immediately pertinent to our understanding of cometary nucleus density and structure (of great relevance in the assessment of viable NEO mitigation strategies), the relationship between rotation & activity, links between JFCs and Kuiper Belt Objects and their formation, and complement extensive campaigns to date to study size, albedo and color properties. Furthermore, accurate spin state data could be used in the selection and subsequent planning of any future NASA missions to these 'time capsules' of the early solar system."
GO13035,13,Tabetha,Suzanne,Boyajian,Yale University,tabetha.boyajian@yale.edu,"Silva Aguirre, Victor; Huber, Daniel; Creevey, Orlagh; White, Timothy R",Testing asteroseismology with bright red giants using C11-13 K2 timeseries and inferometry,"We propose to observe bright red giants stars in long cadence mode in the K2 fields 11-13, where interferometric and high-resolution spectroscopic supporting observations will allow us to address several exciting science questions pertaining to 1) asteroseismic scaling relations, 2) chemical mixing processes in stellar interiors, and 3) the abundance of helium. 
Widely used in the asteroseismology of red giants, asteroseismic scaling relations connect stellar properties such as masses and radii to easy-to-derive seismic parameters such as the frequency of maximum power and the large frequency separation. Although scaling relations do have some theoretical justification, they are still mostly based on the only star whose parameters we truly know: the Sun. The precise seismic K2 observations coupled with high-quality ground-based interferometric and spectroscopic data of bright nearby giants will allow us to subject the scaling relations to the most demanding tests. 
The second application is to constrain the poorly understood mixing processes working inside red giants, such as thermohaline mixing, rotation, and deep circulation. These processes are predicted to have different impact at different stages of red giant evolution, and to leave imprints in the surface chemical composition of a star. Precise seismic log (g) from K2 time series, coupled with high resolution spectroscopy, will allow for a detailed abundance determination of a large number of chemical species.  The correlations between elements (e.g. [C/ Fe] vs [N/ Fe]) and departure from their theoretically predicted values (as in the case of Li or 12 C/13 C) are tracers of internal mixing processes, and will be studied as a function of the seismically determined mass.
The third goal of this proposal is to address one of the biggest uncertainties in stellar astrophysics: the abundance of helium in stars. The helium second ionization zone inside a star produces an abrupt change in the local sound speed, which is detectable in the Fourier spectrum of time series as a periodic variation. We will construct detailed models of red giants where this variation is detected, and coupled with independent constraints on angular diameter and detailed surface composition, we will put stringent constraints on the helium abundance of red giants and test our assumptions on enrichment laws of the Galaxy.
We have selected ~30 bright (Kp<8) red giants which are ideally suited for this project due to their precisely determined distances, large angular sizes for interferometry, and detectable oscillations in the 80 day K2 baseline. Red giants observed by Kepler were generally too faint to meet these criteria, making K2 uniquely suited to perform these observations. Our proposal addresses compelling questions in stellar structure and evolution, and is hence directly related to the K2 GO solicitation."

For these binary stars, we find a striking deficiency of small planets. We propose to observe more known binary stars to confirm the deficiency. We consider only S-type circumstellar planet system, in which a planet orbits one of the binary stars, NOT circumbinary planets (P-type).

Our sample consists of 1208 binary stars, which represents the largest sample of binary stars for planet search. This sample will allow us to study small and large planets in binary stars. The former can be uniquely probed by the K2 mission. We will reduce the measurement uncertainty by a factor of 2-3, which will place better constraints on the occurrence rate of planets in binary stars

Targeting binary stars with no prior information of planet helps to unambiguously address the planet occurrence rate in binary stars. Increasing the sample size helps not only to confirm the deficiency of planets in binary stars but also study the influence of stellar companions on planets with different sizes and orbital separations. Future NASA mission in search of habitable worlds will inevitably encounter with this question: to select binary stars or not, which account for 33% of stars in the solar neighborhood. This proposal will pave the way to solve this question."

Indeed, K2 observed the first such example in Campaign 1: WD1145+017 (Vanderburg et al. 2015).  Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013). The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations. The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]).  Given the extreme difficulty of measuring atmospheric properties of Earth-sized planets around solar-like stars, our first biomarker characterization of an Earth-sized planetary atmosphere, may come from an object transiting a white dwarf star. Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015). I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours. 

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns).

Methodology: Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total. The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits. The first planets detected were around a compact object, a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992).  Additionally, N-body simulations of planetary systems through stellar evolution indicate it is possible to return significant mass objects back very close to the white dwarf (Veras & Gaensicke 2015), so it is likely for white dwarfs to host planets. Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign. Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence. Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground. While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation. However, a followup campaign on known targets is quite straightforward. At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope. However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO13038,13,William,D.,Cochran,The University of Texas at Austin,wdc@astro.as.utexas.edu,"Shporer, Avi; Johnson, Marshall C",Probing the Planetary Population of High-Mass Stars (K2-GO4),"Objectives: To date most planet searches have been confined to stars of spectral type F and later, as hotter stars have fewer spectral lines and tend to be rapidly rotating, making precise radial velocity (RV) observations difficult. By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiant stars in this mass range [1], but the masses of these subgiants have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus ~60 planet candidates that are awaiting validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement subgiant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets, and close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the subgiants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars. There are currently only ~10 such confirmed planets; this population is currently almost totally unexplored. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2.

Targets: We plan to request approximately 400 long cadence targets, ~3/4 of which will be in Field 11. The sample will consist of A and early F-type dwarfs with 8<V<12.5, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: Our colleagues at the DLR and University of Cologne (Germany) will prepare lightcurves and search for transit signals. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory and the forthcoming NRES spectrographs on the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT); we will leverage our group's experience with similar observations of Kepler prime mission targets. For long-period targets where the K2 observations are insufficient to constrain the transit emphemeris, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with LCOGT. Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other techniques. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (which uses the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect on rapidly rotating stars, where the spectral line distortion during transit is spectroscopically resolved) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit. This will continue our program to validate Kepler prime mission candidates using Doppler tomography [5]; we will use the same methodology for K2 candidates.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

GO13039,13,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",Monitoring of Targets Within 100 Parsecs,"Science Goals and Objectives: Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 parsecs provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres. A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets. It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come. I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 pc.  A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons. This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes. This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques.  Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars.  While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges. A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be 200-300 stars (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars). In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored. The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets.

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability. An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003). One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium. This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint. Long cadence observations would be appropriate.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found. These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."

E.; Raddi, Roberto; Bell, Keaton","K2 Observations of Variable White Dwarfs in Fields 11, 12 and 13","We propose observations of variable white dwarfs (WDs) in Fields 11-13 of the K2 mission. We propose short-cadence observations of known and high-probability pulsating WDs. We additionally propose short-cadence observations of known magnetic and metal-polluted white dwarfs to constrain magnetic activity in these stars, and to search for possible transits in around stars with known evolved planetary systems.

As they cool, WDs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres pulsate as DAVs (a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) when they reach the appropriate effective temperature to foster a hydrogen partial-ionization zone, which efficiently drives global oscillations. This range of temperatures empirically spans roughly 12,600-11,100 K for typical-mass (0.6 Msun) WDs. Pulsating WDs provide an important glimpse into the interior of the future of the vast majority (> 97%) of all stars in our Galaxy, including our Sun, allowing us to probe the masses and compositions of their electron-degenerate cores, as well as of their non-degenerate envelopes; to determine their internal rotation profiles; and to detect weak magnetic fields.

Since the DAV instability strip is defined by temperature, color selection is an excellent predictor of variability. Our team discovered all DAVs in the original Kepler mission, which is leading to exquisite insight into white dwarf interiors. We have applied the same photometric selection methods to K2 Fields 11-13 using the SDSS, VST/ATLAS, and VPHAS+ multiwavelength surveys, and have identified 75 excellent candidate white dwarfs on silicon in the three fields with colors consistent with the empirical DAV and DBV instability strips. Additionally, there are three previously published pulsating white dwarfs in Field 12. We have used ground-based resources to refine the atmospheric parameters of many of these candidates, confirming than a large number fall within the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. Additionally, we have confirmed pulsations in two new white dwarfs using ground-based high-speed photometry. With typical pulsations ranging from 100-1400 s, we require short-cadence observations of these white dwarfs.

Every new DAV we can observe with K2 adds significant legacy value, since it brings us that much closer to statistically significant studies of white dwarfs with ensemble asteroseismology. There were only six pulsating white dwarfs in the original Kepler mission, but that number has grown to at least 20 with K2, and will continue to grow as the extended mission progresses.

Additionally, we propose long-cadence observations of all other WD candidates in these fields, to continue our in-depth study into rotation, magnetic activity, planetary systems, and binarity in the endpoints of stellar evolution. These observations simultaneously allow for serendipitous discoveries, including possible eclipses or transits, as demonstrated by the unique disintegrating planetesimal orbiting a WD in K2 Campaign 1 (Vanderburg et al. 2015, Nature, 526, 546)."

Many sdBs are known to have close companions with periods ranging from 0.05 to 10 days, and must have evolved through the common-envelope-ejection (CEE) process. The closest systems are quite easy to study from the ground, but Kepler observations have opened the door for precise studies of the population of systems with periods between 0.5 and and 10 days.

Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission. The excellent Kepler light curves show photometric signals from Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal deformations and mutual irradiation effects. Long-cadence K2 observations presents us with an unique opportunity to accumulate a larger sample of post-common envelope sdB binaries that can shed light on the statistics of the CEE process, and thereby constrain the long sought after efficiency parameters that govern the common envelope stage of evolution. In the process we hope to find new particularly interesting binary systems, such as the eclipsing cases and those with extraordinary masses that could be progenitors of type-Ia supernovae."

So far, stars brighter than Kp < 6 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 long-cadence observations of the brightest K2 stars in campaigns 11-13 (including 36 Oph, the brightest K dwarf observable by K2) using a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels. Asteroseismic studies of these targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants and insights into poorly understood internal processes of intermediate-mass stars such as convective core overshooting.

We selected 54 targets with Kp < 6.0 mag from the Hipparcos catalog. We will use small (~20x20 pixel) circular apertures around the saturated core for each target, and perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method (so-called halo photometry) has been demonstrated to detect pulsations for all bright Pleiades and Hyades stars observed in Campaign 4. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Our proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics, a key science goal of the K2 mission. Our project furthermore supports galactic astrophysics, another key science area identified in the NRA, through the calibration of scaling relations for galactic archeology studies.

Due to their diversity in fundamental properties (masses, luminosities, chemical compositions), low-luminosity red-giant branch (LLRGB) stars are ideal targets to tackle two key unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of host star mass, and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets. An initial analysis of LLRGB stars observed for our C4-C5 program has already yielded the discovery of the first potentially re-inflated warm Jupiter around an oscillating evolved star, and we propose to continue our survey by observing ~5400 targets in C11-C13 to build up a statistically significant planet sample. 

We have selected targets using spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, RAVE and LAMOST, as well as colors and reduced proper motions. Planet candidates will be detected with K2 long-cadence data using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since LLRGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up ground-based radial velocity observations will be used to confirm the planets.

The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing LLRGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

For billions of years the Earth's shadow against the Sun has swept a path through space revealing our existence to the stellar neighbors that have passed within 0.26 degrees of the ecliptic.  We propose to survey all GKM dwarf stars within 1.0 degree of the ecliptic using the K2 spacecraft in order to identify transiting planetary systems that can mutually discover Earth via transit observations performed by another civilization in the last ~100,000 yrs.  This survey will significantly expand the number of ecliptic aligned planets known from the two Jupiter-class planets with 0.26 degrees of the current ecliptic (the hot-Jupiter, WASP-47b and the direct imaging, 5 Myr old 1RXS-J160929b) into the regime of Super-Earth size planets.

Methodology:
We will employ our extensive background in the analysis of Kepler data in order to search and provide a catalog of planet candidates from the K2 data within the ecliptic using tools and techniques developed for Kepler.  The primary goal is to generate a catalog of planet candidates for prioritization of SETI searches.  Secondary goals are to provide a well vetted sample of planet candidates to the community to follow up for asteroseismic or spectroscopic stellar characterization and radial velocity confirmation.   Future follow up with SETI resources of KEES planet candidates will provide the first constraints on the fraction of stars hosting at least one inner planet, that can discover Earth transit, and that contain intelligent life detectable to the SETI detection limits.

Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system, colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk, & studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength limiting models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies. 

Lightcurves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations and their origins. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. These 2 populations are in resonances with Jupiter & collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations. Results from the WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojans & ~40% of Hildas are either extremely elongated objects or binaries. Kepler optical light curves are required to confirm these controversial findings. Ground based surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability study due to large amounts of observing time required & nightly aliasing effects on lightcurves. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform and the correspondence between the C11 field and the L4 Trojan cloud. 


Methodology: We have identified 100 objects for study in the Hilda and Trojan asteroids to be studied with Kepler in C11-13 with magnitudes of m_V < 20. Due to the overlap between the Campaign 11 field and the L4 Trojan cloud, our request for data represents 70 objects Campaign 11, 23 objects in Campaign 12 & 7 objects in Campaign 13. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 24 days. Due to the motion of these targets, the Kepler Science Center assesses solar system program as containing more targets than proposed number of objects, (In C8, 6 Hilda targets are assessed as 4847 targets by the Kepler Science Center), thus THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity.

Relevance to K2:
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 11-13  to determine if these objects originated in the Kuiper Belt and later migrated and are amenable to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission and defined observing fields."
GO13052,13,Billy,L,Quarles,SETI Institute,billylquarles@gmail.com,"Rowe, Jason Frank; Antoci, Victoria",The heat is on: exoplanets that orbit hot stars,"Science Goals Objectives: The Kepler Mission has discovered a few thousand planet candidates, which has allowed for a statistical determination of planet size and orbital characterization.   In particular, multi-planet systems, where more than one planet is seen transiting a star have provided a wealth of information covering statistical confirmations, eccentricity distributions, mutual inclinations and dynamical stability.  We have learned that not only are planets plentiful, but are found in relatively flat and circular orbits.  However, this knowledge of the architecture exoplanetary systems is only currently valid for cooler G, K and M-dwarf stars, which were the prime targets from the original Kepler Mission.  From the Kepler Q1-Q17 catalogue there are only 254 planet-candidate systems where the host star has an effective temperature greater than 6500 K.  In stars with temperatures hotter than ~6500 K the stellar envelope structure and evolution on the main sequence is dominated by radiative transfer, opposed to cooler stars where convection plays an important role.   Misalignments between the planets orbital plane and stellar spin axis have been predominately found for stars with radiative atmospheres, whereas stars with convective envelopes typically show close alignment.  This observation is likely linked to the coupling of convective atmospheres and tidal forces.  As such, we wish to continue making observations with K2 to determine the occurrence rate and orbital properties of multi-planet systems around hot stars.

Methodology: The Kepler Mission was a planet finding machine!  Our team has extensive knowledge and experience with Kepler photometric data for both transit finding and analysis as well as performing asteroseismic analysis of stars with temperatures greater than 6500 K.  We have 236 targets selected for observation in C8 and will investigate a much larger list of target stars over C11, C12, and C13.  One of the problems of searching for planets around hotter stars is that many are known to pulsate (e.g. dSct and gDor type).  Fortunately, the pulsations can be identified and accounted for from photometric light curves to allow searches for planets to reach low-noise levels.  Our plan is to use detrended photometric data and apply asteroseismic tools to remove stellar phenomena that may affect the data and to then search for transiting planets.  We will then study the properties of the planet-candidates using transit-depths, transit-durations and impact parameter to estimate the distributions of orbital properties.  We will also estimate our planet search completeness and compare our measured properties to the properties of planetary systems found around cooler stars.

Relevance to Kepler-GO Program: Using space-based astronomical observations of star fields with K2, we will search for and characterize new planets around hot stars. Our research has the potential to determine whether the properties of the host star, convective or radiative atmospheres, play a role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.  Our proposed investigation is part of a multiple observing campaign search for which we have 236 stars selected for observation in a previous proposal.  Through our continued search of stars on the ecliptic, we will collect observations to make sure we find ample planetary systems around hot-stars to meet our research goals."

The red clump stars are bright and cool enough to be well suited for asteroseismic analysis, including age determinations. Such a large sample will give us the new opportunity to do a statistically robust asteroseismic age determination for young core-helium burning stars. Previously this could only be done for older clusters that have a heavily populated first-ascent giant branch, and our analysis will produce a much improved calibration of these more massive giant stars.

NGC 1817 is also young enough that main sequence stars fall in the pulsational instability strip, and it is old enough that the most evolved main sequence turnoff stars are also within the strip. The cluster is already known to have a large population of delta Sct and gamma Dor pulsating stars that will benefit from uninterrupted observations, and the sensitivity of the K2 photometry will allow the detection of many additional low-amplitude pulsators that could not be detected from the ground. But the cluster also provides us with the rare opportunity to precisely measure the mass and radius of a pulsating delta Sct star, as one is already known to be part of a cluster eclipsing binary. This would provide a benchmark case for the study of delta Sct pulsators, and the evolved nature of that star will produce an independent determination of the cluster age for comparison with asteroseismic results.

We propose long cadence observations of all of the known red clump star members of the cluster (for asteroseismology), all of the known pulsating stars (with short cadence observations of 3 known to have high frequency modes), the bright eclipsing binary (again with short cadence), and all other bright main sequence members for the detection of additional pulsators and eclipsing systems."

Thanks to its fast photometric cadence, continuous monitoring and high photometric accuracy, Kepler has provided unprecedented insights into various types of compact binaries, and holds an enormous potential for other astrophysical domains on top of planet hunting. Some of the most notable studies have revealed i) the mass ratio and precise orbital parameters through Doppler beaming and Romer delays for compact binaries (Bloemen et al. 2011, MNRAS,410, 178, Bloemen et al. 2012, MNRAS, 422, 2600), ii) the discovery of the rms-flux relation in the aperiodic flickering of accreting white dwarfs (WD, Scaringi et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 2854) iii) stringent tests to the disk instability model through the precise characterization of dwarf nova (DN) outburst cycles and (Cannizzo et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 117) iv) the discovery of a universal scaling relation linking the timing properties of Active Galactic Nuclei, accreting stellar-mass black holes, accreting white dwarfs and young-stellar objects (Scaringi et al. 2015, Sci. Adv, e1500686).

Here we propose to continue exploiting the capabilities of Kepler/K2, and specifically ask to observe 13 targets (6 SC and 7 LC) in Campaign 11, 3 (1 SC and 2 LC) in Campaign 12 and 2 (1 SC and 1 LC) in Campaign 13. Most targets have been selected from the Ritter & Kolb catalogue (A&A, 404, 301). Campaign 11 is particularly interesting given its close proximity to the Galactic centre, providing the opportunity to observe various X-ray binaries, including accreting stellar-mass black holes for the first time with Kepler. Because of this, additional targets are included in our target list as known X-ray binaries in Campaign 11. The precise target list will be defined on submission of the Step 2 proposal.

For all targets in our sample we will probe their broad-band variability properties. Together with similar targets observed during the previous K2 campaigns, this will form the most comprehensive study of optical aperiodic variability in accreting compact objects. Additionally for some systems we will also study the periodic emission (see e.g. Sco X-1 from Campaign 2, Scaringi et al. 2015, MNRAS, 451, 3857). With K2 we will be able to precisely fold the optical lightcurves on the orbital period of the systems. This in turn will allow us to isolate and study the different emission components arising form the secondary star, accretion disk and boundary layer/corona of the accreting objects themselves as a function of orbital phase."

evolution models with binary stars","The mass discrepancy problem in binary stars stands for the difference between the stellar component masses inferred from binary dynamics and those obtained from spectral characteristics of stars and evolutionary models. The problem clearly points to some missing physical ingredients in stellar structure and evolution theory, and is often solved by introducing an additional near core mixing into evolutionary models by means of an unusually large core overshoot. Our goal is an independent seismic evaluation of the core overshoot parameter for pulsating binary components.
Binary stars provide a valuable test of the tidal evolution theory. This theory, in particular, describes the evolution of eccentric binary orbits into the stage of two stars with synchronized spin rates and residing in a circular orbit. Current theory predicts time-scale of spins synchronization to be shorter than the time-scale of the orbit circularization. This often contradicts our observations, thus our goal is to test and, if necessary, refine tidal evolution theory, by considering different types of interactions within a binary system.
The resonant excitation of stars free oscillation modes through dynamical tides within a binary system is a direct result of the above mentioned interactions. These tidally induced oscillations provide a potential of probing deep stellar interiors, but the topic is not well explored observationally. We shall remedy the lack of high-quality photometric data for massive binary stars and detections of their tidally-induced oscillations.
A statistically significant sample of pulsating binaries with precise masses is required to meet our science goals. The current sample consists of about a hundred of binaries and is greatly biased towards short orbital periods (< 10 d). With K2, we aim at observing about 100 members of the class of massive binary stars, which will lead to significant extension of the sample, in particular towards longer orbital periods.
Our team has all necessary tools and expertise to perform photometric and spectroscopic data reduction and analyses. The pixel data files delivered by the K2 mission will be used to extract the light curves by means of the software available at the host institute of the project PI. We will rely on the data analysis strategy that proved to be very efficient (e.g., Tkachenko et al. 2014, MNRAS, 438, 3093) and comprises of using the methods like Wilson-Devinney and spectral disentangling for the analysis of light curves and stellar spectra, respectively.
The K2 mission is the only available instrument to deliver the required data for our science goal. The high-quality photometric data, coupled with the state-of-the-art modelling tools, will ensure accurate subtraction of the orbital signal from the light curves, and will allow accurate frequency and asteroseismic analyses. Tidally induced pulsations have periods of a few days, so long cadence is sufficient for our targets. 
The present team was a part of the MASSIVE consortium applying for the K2 observations during previous campaigns. We used the experience gained from previous campaigns to do a careful selection of the best K2 targets for our aims in the fields of Campaigns 11,12,&13. The total number of targets to be proposed for the observations is estimated to be about 15."
GO13058,13,Joshua,,Pepper,Lehigh University,joshua.pepper@lehigh.edu,"Stassun, Keivan Guadalupe; Rodriguez, Joseph Enrique",Understanding the Precursors to Disk Eclipsing Systems,"It is known that planets form from the gas and dust in the protoplanetary disks surrounding young stellar objects (YSOs). What is not clear is what governs the large diversity of planet types and of planetary system architectures that are now being discovered by the thousands. The circumstellar environment involves a variety of processes that lead to the evolution of the protoplanetary disk over time. These processes include accretion onto the star, dispersion by stellar winds and radiation, magnetic fields, outflows, and in many cases stellar companions. Each of these different features can manifest as disk substructures, gradients, and other properties that could reveal the mechanisms that influence planet formation and diversity therein. One method to constrain the planet-building properties of these disks is to observe them as they fortuitously eclipse their stars. Such events are very rare, with only a few discovered, but have already led to such insights as dense planet-forming structures within the tidally disrupted disk of the young binary star system (Rodriguez et al. 2013, AJ, 146, 122), Saturn-like rings and gaps in the disk surrounding a young planet (Mamajek et al. 2012, AJ, 143, 72), stratified dust coagulation within a young protoplanetary disk (Bouvier et al. 2013, A&A, 557, A77; Rodriguez et al. 2015, AJ, 150, 32), and an evolved binary star system with remnant planet-building material (Rodriguez et al. Accepted, AJ). Therefore, using time series photometry from Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT), we are conducting the Disk Eclipse Search with KELT (DESK) survey to look for large dimming events cause by a feature of the stars circumstellar environment, specifically in young stellar associations. To date, the survey has discovered and analyzed four previously unknown large dimming events around the stars RW Aurigae, V409 Tau, and TYC 2505-672-1, the latter now representing the longest-period eclipsing object known (period ~ 69 years). In most of these discovered systems, the eclipse is either already occurring or the system has recovered to its original brightness at the time of discovery; limiting our ability to characterize the system and the occulting mechanism. However, It is very likely that there are specific pre-eclipse photometric signatures that could allow us to predict an upcoming large occultation. These precursors would include small amplitude (<1 mmag) eclipses due to the leading edge of a large occulting body beginning to cross in front of the host star. Unfortunately, ground based surveys do not provide the photometric precision or continuous observations required to search for these very small signals. Therefore, we request K2 observations of the ~30 brightest young stars in the Taurus-Auriga association that have corresponding observations from the KELT survey, allowing the ability to probe small amplitude photometric variability, gaining insight to the precursors of larger dimming events. 

The proposed K2 observations will be combined with other ground based observations from surveys like KELT, the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), and Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard (DASCH), providing up to a century long baseline of observations with a variety of photometric precisions. By searching for periodic and non periodic photometric variability on timescales from days to weeks (K2) and months to decades (KELT, AAVSO, and DASCH), we will be able to study stellar phenomena such as rotation, pulsation, shallow eclipses, flares, and outbursts that will help illuminate the underlying mechanisms of the system. Continued monitoring of these systems by KELT and AAVSO will allow us to look for future large dimming events and test the possible of predictive features observed in the K2 observations."
GO13059,13,Joshua,,Pepper,Lehigh University,joshua.pepper@lehigh.edu,"Labadie-Bartz, Jonathan Michael",Variability of Be Stars,"We propose to observe seven Be-type stars in K2 Campaigns 11 and 13. Be stars are rapidly rotating, with spectral type B and luminosity class V-III that exhibit line emission, which is attributed to a gaseous circumstellar disk in Keplerian motion. The physical mechanism behind the disk creation is still unclear, but the very rapid stellar rotation combined with non-radial pulsations is theorized to play an important role via mass outbursts which transfer material from the star to the disk. These outbursts appear in photometry, typically as a sudden brightening of the system followed by a more gradual return to the pre-outburst brightness level. Transient pulsational modes are sometimes associated with outbursts, showing different frequencies and amplitudes before, during, and after the outburst event (Huat et al. 2009, with CoRoT).

For 3 of the stars proposed here, we have existing light curves with baselines of many years from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT; Pepper et al. 2007) - a ground based photometric survey designed to find transiting exoplanets. Notably, HD 32190 is a classical Be star with a 9-year KELT light curve that shows very strong outburst features (up to 0.5 mag) on timescales of ~1 year, with smaller scale outbursts superimposed. Simultaneous spectroscopic observations from the Be Star Spectral Database (BeSS; Neiner et al. 2011) show significant line profile variability that is correlated in time with these photometric outbursts. K2 provides a photometric precision and uninterrupted observing window that is unavailable with ground-based observing strategies, and will allow us to study pulsations and low-amplitude outbursts that are unseen in the KELT data. The additional context given by the KELT photometric data and the BeSS spectra make HD 32190 a valuable target for an in-depth analysis, regardless of the outburst stage during the K2 observations. Another star, HD 30123, has 7 years of KELT data, but does not exhibit any clear variability or outbursts that are resolved the KELT light curve. The existing spectra for this object are simultaneous with KELT photometry and show a strong single-peaked emission line profile that grows over the course of three years, so it is likely that there are in fact outbursts injecting material into the disk with amplitudes and/or durations too small to be detectable with KELT data. K2 photometry would likely reveal these outbursts (and possibly pulsations), providing evidence that even Be stars that appear to be photometrically stable from the ground can exhibit variability in the form of pulsations and outbursts.

GO13064,13,Marcel,,Agueros,Columbia University,marcel@astro.columbia.edu,"Covey, Kevin; Cargile, Phillip A; Douglas, Stephanie T",How the Other Half Lives: Completing the K2 Census of Low-Mass Hyads,"Although it has been known for decades that rotation and magnetic activity in main-sequence stars decrease with age, a quantitative description of the age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR) still eludes us. Empirical calibrations of the ARAR rely on observations of the co-eval populations of stars in open clusters: the well-defined ages of these stars make them valuable targets for measuring rotation periods and proxies for magnetic field strength, such as H-alpha and X-ray luminosities.

The Hyades offers the greatest opportunity for understanding the underlying ARAR physics for low-mass stars, for which this relation remains particularly uncertain. The ~600 Myr-old cluster is the closest open cluster to the Sun; at 47 pc, even the faintest cluster members are accessible targets for activity observations. The cluster members are widely spread out on the sky, however, which makes ground-based period measurements of the faintest Hyads prohibitive. By contrast, with its wide field of view and high photometric precision, K2 has already allowed us to obtain periods for Hyads as small as ~0.1 Msun. In Douglas et al. (2016), we measured rotation periods for 48 of 65 Hyads observed in C4, obtaining the first periods for fully convective Hyads. We found that removing confirmed binaries has a significant impact on the morphology of the mass-period plane, and that magnetic braking may behave differently in early M dwarfs and in higher-mass stars. We require more rotation measurements in the Hyades to confirm these effects and examine them in more detail.  

In addition to characterizing the evolution of stellar angular momentum, our interest lies in exploring the link between rotation and magnetic activity. We are collecting new and archival optical spectra and X-ray detections for low-mass members of nearby open clusters. In Douglas et al. (2014), we used rotation and activity data for Hyades and Praesepe members to find that H-alpha activity and X-ray activity decline differently with slower rotation. This supports the theory that X-ray activity saturates for the fastest rotators. However, the different mass distributions of stars with H-alpha and X-ray measurements make that support tentative at best. We require a large sample of stars with period and chromospheric and coronal activity measurements to more definitively test magnetic dynamo and field structure theories.

We propose to obtain K2 light curves for 150 Hyades members in C13, including >80 M dwarfs. Our K2 survey will build on our large-scale effort to map out rotation periods in low-mass stars in several open clusters. C13 provides an extraordinary opportunity to complete the sample of rotation periods for Hyades stars, providing access to longer, lower-amplitude signals than can currently be measured from the ground. 

We will use our period-measurement routines, developed to analyze C4 and C5 data, to search each C13 light curve for signatures of stellar rotation. In parallel, we will continue our spectroscopic and X-ray survey of the Hyades, relying primarily on the 2.4-m Hiltner telescope at MDM Observatory, AZ. Columbia University owns a 25% share of MDM, and we have obtained long-term status for spectroscopic work related to this survey. We have also received time on XMM and Swift to carry out snapshot X-ray surveys of low-mass Hyads. We will combine each star's period measurement with diagnostics of chromospheric and coronal activity to examine the dependence of magnetic activity on rotation, thereby also providing firmer constraints on the magnetic environment around low-mass stars. 

The Hyades is a benchmark cluster for the ARAR, which can be used to measure the ages of exoplanet host stars. This proposal therefore supports NASA's goal of understanding exoplanetary systems."

Two complementary approaches have been adopted, the first centered on in-depth studies of the Sun itself, and the second focusing on the study of solar analogs, stars which are like the Sun and thus might shed light on characteristics of its composition, structure, activity, planetary system, evolution, and future. The utility of the study of solar analogs is broad, ranging from finding night-time proxies for the Sun for calibration purposes to their use as snapshots of the evolutionary history of the Sun. Their study has helped to establish that chromospheric activity is key to understanding stellar rotation, activity, and dynamos. The project proposed here is aimed at providing a large consistent set of well-vetted solar analogs in order to address these questions. We will make use of the K2 mission fields to obtain precise photometric time series of approximately 1000 solar analogs, supplemented by asteroseismology and ground- and space-based spectroscopic data for the brighter and more promising candidates. From this data we will derive rotation periods, spot coverages, and flare rates for a well-calibrated sample of solar analogs. This work expands on the PIs ongoing Kepler and K2 analysis, and supports an ongoing project under NASA's Living With a Star program; the use of new fields will also allow us to compare different stellar populations and provide a growing sample of test data for the study of stellar activity, rotation, and dynamos.

The chosen targets will be selected on the basis of existing ground-based photometry supplemented by spectroscopy when available and guided by previous results and population models using TRILEGAL. We anticipate that <10% of the stars in our sample will be giants, but we can make use of light curves and power spectra to eliminate giants from our sample after the fact based on granulation noise (Mathur et al. 2011, Bastien et al. 2013, 2015). We will reduce our limiting magnitude from the ~14 we used for Kepler to ~12.5 to roughly compensate for the increased noise in K2 compared to Kepler, and make ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up easier. In addition,  our brightest candidates should be amenable to asteroseismology."

Kepler monitored 15 of these systems. The detailed coverage enabled unique studies of quiescent orbital and sporadic variability as well as the changes in the disk and stream impact area during short and long dwarf nova outbursts. We propose to monitor a set of CVs in the K2 fields of Campaigns 11, 12 and 13. The Cycle 4 fields represent the extremes of stellar densities with the directions toward the pole and Galactic center. We have matched the K2 fields with several CV databases and a total of 17 targets are requested in this cycle.

They are crucial objects for understanding the structure and evolution of stars, and to explore connections between pulsation, mass loss, convection and rotation. Moreover, they are key tools in galactic and extragalactic studies as distance indicators. Still, only a few members of this group have been observed by space missions before K2. We are currently building up the most comprehensive sample of Cepheid light curves with the K2 mission and the upcoming field of views contain many important targets in various directions of the Galaxy. 

Space-based, continuous photometry revealed many puzzling phenomena in these stars. The lone Kepler Cepheid, V1154 Cyg exhibit small-scale irregularities (period jitter) and low-level modulation. Ground-based surveys indicate that first overtone stars are expected to have various low-amplitude additional modes. Hydrodynamical calculations suggest that various dynamical effects and even chaos can occur in the pulsation of type II Cepheids. These effects hold clues to various physical insights, but their observations require high-precision, continuous photometry that only K2 can provide. 

The three campaigns focus on very different Galactic directions:

The bulge
In Field 11 we identified ~150 targets, most of which are type II Cepheids. 124 candidates were collected from the still unpublished data of the OGLE IV survey. The high-priority targets include rare double- and triple-mode Cepheids, such as V767 Sgr, among others. 15 targets that we also included in our C9 DDT proposal fall into the overlapping region between Campaigns 9 and 11. Given the long pulsation periods of Cepheids, extended observations are highly desired. In addition, two Cepheids are members of globular clusters M9 and NGC 6316.  

The halo
The direction of Field 12 is not favorable for these stars, but we found 6 targets, of which 3 appear to be anomalous Cepheids. Many aspects of these stars are not well understood, including their formation. 

The outer Milky Way
In Field 13, towards the anti-center we found 10 targets. The priority target in this campaign is the well-known Cepheid SZ Tau that was already observed by MOST and it is accessible for the BRITE space telescopes as well. The star pulsates in the first overtone, so additional modes and/or dynamical effects are expected. The short MOST data already suggested the presence of some cycle-to-cycle variations. The observations would provide direct comparison of the capabilities of various space missions and form a multi-year data set for this star. 
 
Technical details
The KASC Working Group 7 has been involved in the Kepler mission from the start and has all the necessary skills to reduce the target pixel files and analyze the data, including the handling of crowded fields. We propose all stars to be observed in long cadence mode. Two stars, BF Oph and SZ Tau are very bright (6.9 and 6.4 mag, respectively) and can likely be recovered from the smear data. However, we request to assign a dedicated pixel mask to SZ Tau, given the importance and unique possibilities this star offers for us. We also note that BF Oph and SZ Tau are bright enough to be included in the Tycho-Gaia Asterometric Solution, expected to be released in 2016."

We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2, conducting reconnaissance spectroscopy, and ultimately gathering high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models. 

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small. 

We propose a ranked list of 13,356 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We generated this list by first searching for all moderately bright stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 11, 12, and 13, and then using the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. We also propose one short-cadence target: HIP116454, the first exoplanet system discovered from K2, which our team published last year.

We will identify planet candidates using the planet detection pipeline developed by our team members. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities. 

The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 80 nights per year of guaranteed time per year. The follow-up of small planets from Kepler and K2 is the top scientific priority of HARPS-N. 

We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. Our team has already delivered such products for previous K2 campaigns. 

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a significant impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."

Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are the atmosphere-stripped cores of horizontal branch stars some of which happen to pulsate, and that allows us to probe their structure. From Kepler's main 
mission, we learned how to identify pulsation modes to constrain structure models from period spacings and frequency multiplets. Period spacings also help to discern internal structure and age- some stars show mode trapping while in others it is almost completely absent. The amount (and location) of the mode trapping sequence is a function of the core structure which evolves with time. By sampling sdB stars of different evolutionary age and envelope mass, we can use the small deviations of period spacings to constrain structure models.Frequency multiplets also tell us rotation periods and orientation of pulsation axes. From this information we can measure rotation profiles and have discovered that rotation periods are long (20-100 days), even for stars with binary periods down to 0.4 days. This is a surprising result as it has been assumed that close binaries quickly tidally lock their components. From K2 Campaign 1, we discovered the first known ellipsoidal variable which rotates subsynchronously. We made significant progress from the original Kepler mission. However, each sdB pulsator we have examined so far has had unique features. This tells us that we have not  completed the characterization of helium-fusing cores across their range of age (from zero-age to terminal-age on the horizontal branch) and temperature (an indicator of the envelope-to-core mass ratio). To fully exploit K1 and K2 data, we need more pulsators to cover the complete range. It would also be a huge benefit to have more examples of pulsators in binaries, as that allows us to more fully explore how angular momentum is conserved and/or transferred during envelope ejection. Thus far, we have discovered one solid-body rotator and one radially-differential rotator. To continue working toward a complete understanding of horizontal branch cores (including mass loss and post-helium-flash evolution), we are proposing 
that K2 obtain short-cadence (SC) observations of a selection of known and likely sdB pulsators. The SC data can fully exploit pulsations and short-period (1 day) binaries. Only K2 provides sufficient accuracy, duty cycle, and duration necessary to fully understand the pulsations. There is no planned mission that can compete with the accuracy of K2. K2 really is the only tool for this work. Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including 
spectroscopic characterization, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have published over 20 papers from Kepler's main mission.
We will be proposing for about five to eight stars per campaign. We only apply for the most promising targets, both in terms of pulsations and interesting binary properties. We are proposing to observe two binary pulsators, EQ Psc, discovered with K2's engineering data and V1405 Ori, a rare p-mode pulsator in a short-period binary. We have also incorporated students into our work. Many of our papers include undergraduate students as significant contributors. Missouri State University does not have a graduate program, and as a result, undergraduate students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret NASA Satellite data to detect pulsations and signatures of binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterization studies, providing them with a broad range of training. Graduate students at European partner institutions will also be working with us; processing and interpreting pulsations as part of their thesis work."

This presents a unique opportunity to characterize the rotation and magnetic properties of young M stars, as well as the orbital properties of their planetary systems.  At an estimated age of 625 million years, the M dwarfs in the Hyades cluster should be rotating rapidly enough that the K2 observational baseline should cover more than one full stellar rotation period, allowing for robust determination of the rotation rates of these stars.  Given the ubiquity of low-mass planets in short-period orbits around M stars from the original Kepler mission, it should also be expected that K2 observations of Hyades M dwarfs will reveal a population of exoplanets that would be difficult to discover with radial velocity (RV) due to the stars rapid rotation and strong magnetic activity.

We intend to use K2 to monitor a set of ~200 young M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere, and as necessary obtain high-cadence spectroscopy of these stars using HPF (a near-infrared spectrometer) and the upgraded HET/HRS spectrograph. We expect to accomplish three primary scientific objectives:

1)  We will explore the disparate effects of stellar magnetic activity on photometric and spectroscopic observations, and their physical origins.  Previous studies of low-mass stars suggest that spectroscopy and photometry can display markedly different aspects of a stars activity.  One particularly interesting such example is the planet-host M dwarf GJ 176, which we propose to observe with K2 in Campaign 13.  Robertson et al. (2015) showed that the star exhibits a photometric rotation signal that stays in phase over many years, but the spectral rotation signal (as observed by activity-sensitive line cores and RV) goes out of phase after a single observing season.  The broad spectral coverage afforded by HRS and HPF will allow us to explore these effects across the entire visible-NIR waveband.

2)  We will use HPF, our new near-infrared, high-precision RV spectrograph to perform RV follow-up observations and confirm transiting exoplanet candidates around M dwarfs identified in the K2 lightcurves, greatly ameliorating activity induced noise in the optical with infrared observations with sufficient precision to confirm planets.

3)  We will use the upgraded HRS spectrograph on HET in its highest resolution mode (R~120k) to obtain vsini measurements of the M dwarfs targeted by K2.  Together with the rotation periods determined from the K2 lightcurves, we will provide estimates of stellar inclinations.  This is especially valuable for the stars around which exoplanets are identified, as it will give estimates of the spin-orbit angles of the planets.  Spin-orbit angles have never been measured for any M dwarf planets, so this result would be the first of its kind.  Furthermore, spin-orbit measurements for cool, young stars may place constraints on models explaining the origins of spin-orbit misalignments.  If, for example, we find that planets around young, early M stars (i.e. those stars with radiative interiors and a convective shell) are misaligned with the stellar spin axis, it would lend credence to the theory that misaligned planets may torque their stars convective shells into alignment over time."

Stellar clusters provide a homogeneous sample of stars in which the major independent variable is the stellar mass. The different ages of the clusters will help us to understand the early dynamical evolution of planetary systems. We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team. The PICK2 project has already collected K2 data on the Hyades, Pleiades, Praesepe and Ruprecht 147 clusters. In this cycle we will be able to include three more distant open clusters (NGC 1674, NGC 1750, and NGC 1758) in our search and return to a different - and previously unexplored - part of the Hyades in K2 Campaign 13.  

o) Methods & techniques:
We will search the K2 light curves for planetary transit signatures. We will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, and high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates. We will perform detailed spectral analysis in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances, and will perform Doppler tomographic analysis of rapidly rotating planetary candidates. Our team has just confirmed two new K2 planets from field 4 (Johnson et al. 2016, ApJ, submitted)

o) Perceived significance:
These results will provide important new constraints on the physics of planetary system formation and early dynamical evolution. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."
GO13081,13,Ann,E.,Wehrle,Space Science Institute,awehrle@spacescience.org,"Carini, Michael Thomas; Wiita, Paul J",Jets or Disks? Using K2 to distinguish between the origins of optical variability in quasars.,"We propose to measure the  long cadence light curves  of a large sample of 417 quasars in Campaign 12 and  2 quasars in Campaign 13. By doubling the size of our currently approved samples, we will increase the number of AGN in which K2 detects variability enough to form  good statistical samples in each quasar class. The AGN are drawn primarily from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Parkes radio surveys, and the 2nd Fermi LAT AGN catalog. They include 4 gamma-ray blazars. Many quasars have been observed in the PanSTARRS Medium Deep Field 10.  Our ongoing K2 observations have already detected significant optical variability in ~ 88% of gamma-ray blazars, including binary black hole candidate OJ 287, ~ 16% of radio loud quasars (RLQs), and ~ 5% of radio quiet quasars (RQQs). 

Our  first goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in the quasars at the time of K2 observations. Three candidate
origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk  with one or more thermal emitting regions. 

Our  second  goal is to see how the optical variability amplitude and power spectral densities of the three main classes of quasars -- blazars, radio loud quasars, and radio quiet quasars -- differ on minute-to-months timescales. We will measure the power spectral densities of the light curves and determine the power spectral density slopes which are related to the underlying variability processes, such as turbulence in the relativistic jets or stochastic fluctuations in thermal emission from segments of the accretion disk."
GO13082,13,Michal,,Siwak,Cracov Pedagogical University,michal.siwak@gmail.com,,A photometric study of pre-main sequence stars,"We propose to continue space-based Kepler photometric monitoring of pre-main sequence stars. In our study we concentrate on Classical T Tauri-type stars (CTTS), well known from rapid and complicated variability due to vigorous accretion of disc plasma. A sample of above 200 stars is proposed for observations, mostly the members of Taurus-Auriga Star Forming Region (Campaign 11 - 50 targets, 12 - 5 targets, 13 - 151 targets). They will provide first large representative sample of stars (both known in Simbad database as YSOs, CTTSs, Herbig Ae/Be, WTTSs, PMSs and carefuly choosen objects classified as emision line stars) of different age and SFR membership to address the following issues: 
1) regime of accretion in CTTS: stable, moderately stable or unstable,
2) does the accretion regime in CTTS alternate between (moderately)stable and unstable, what is the typical timescale,
3) which Herbig Ae/Be stars show magnetically-controlled accretion like CTTS,
4) study of QPOs in CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars with wavelet technique: how fast do they change in time
5) determination of rotational periods of CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars if catched in a stable or moderately stable accretion regime, as well as of WTTS modulated by long lived cold spots (including differential rotation),
6) do other CTTS and Herbig Ae/Be stars show short lasting, shallow dips like TW Hya,
7) does HBC 393 show tiny (amplitude of 1-10%) QPOs, like these discovered by us with MOST for FU Ori in 2009/10 and confirmed in 2013/14 (unpublished,) which may allow for determination of an inner disc radius ?,
8) will we be lucky enough to discover planetary transit around one of the young stars?

Among the proposed targets is HL Tau and LkCa 15, famous from their stunning ALMA and high-contrast images, likely revealing effects of disc-planet interactions and forming protoplanet(s), respectively. To get comparison with photometrically best observed so far from space TW Hya, we will likely ask to observe them in a short-cadence mode. Due to obvious spacecraft limitations, the other targets must be observed in a long-cadence mode only. We propose to observe only these stars which are bright enough for Kepler and well-separated to get accurate photometric precision. The only problem is expected with HBC 393, which may be too faint for Kepler. Yet, we propose to make an attempt to observe the star as it is the only FUor available for it in the closest future.
     Approved Kepler observations of brightest targets, especially CTTS, will be supported by ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic observations to estimate variety of their physical parameters. For this purpose we plan to use Polish access on SALT, SAAO and ESO telescopes."
GO13083,13,Adam,Gabriel,Jensen,University of Nebraska-Kearney,JensenAG@unk.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson; Endl, Michael; Redfield, Seth",Searching for Extended Exoplanetary Atmospheres Around Active Stars,"A key question in studying any planetary atmosphere is what happens at the boundary between the atmosphere and interplanetary space. This unbound, outermost layer of an atmosphere is called its exosphere.  Several observations of extended atmospheres have been made (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Schlawin et al. 2010; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010, 2012; Fossati et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2012; Cauley et al. 2015; Cauley et al. 2016, in preparation) in hydrogen (both ground-state and excited) and various metals.

Our team detected excited, n=2 hydrogen (through hydrogen alpha absorption) in the exosphere of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012), the first such detection in an exoplanet atmosphere. Follow-up observations (Cauley et al. 2015; Cauley et al. 2016, in prep.) confirmed this result by detecting exospheric absorption in hydrogen alpha, hydrogen beta, and hydrogen gamma, and also observed a significant pre-transit signal in these lines.  The pre-transit signal is variable between the two observation sets and the physical interpretation is not clear.  Jensen et al. (2012) hypothesized that the excited hydrogen in the exosphere (the transit signal) may be correlated with chromospheric activity, as HD 189733b, the only planet in that paper's sample of four planets to show H-alpha absorption, was also the most chromospherically active in the sample (as measured by S_HK and log [R'_HK] indices).

In Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 3, we proposed to search for planets around stars which are candidates for chromospheric activity in the Kepler 8 and 10 fields.  We found dozens of suitable targets based on the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Survey's catalogue of chromospherically active stars (Zerjal et al. 2013).  We now propose to do the same for Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 4 for the Kepler Campaign 11, 12, and 13 fields.  Because the 11 and 12 fields are in the southern celestial hemisphere, these are largely covered by the RAVE survey in particular, whereas the RAVE survey mostly covered field 10.  Therefore, we expect to have roughly double the number of targets for this cycle as we did in the previous cycle, roughly tripling the overall sample.  This will greatly improve the chance of success of the accepted Cycle 3 proposal at minimal cost of targets to the K2 mission.

Looking for planets around active stars with radial velocity methods is often disfavored because the stellar noise limits RV precision.  However, this makes the transit method the more important way to detect planets in these cases. Furthermore, if any of these stars do have a transiting planet, they will be excellent potential candidates for follow-up spectroscopy with the large ground-based telescopes (Keck I, HobbyEberly Telescope) that our team has used in the past to detect exospheric absorption. The goal of follow-up spectroscopic observations would be to search for excited hydrogen absorption from an exosphere, including possible pre-transit signals. As a secondary science product, many of these active stars will have light curves worth studying on their own for stellar astrophysics purposes."
GO13085,13,Stephen,,Rinehart,NASA -- Goddard Space Flight Center,Stephen.A.Rinehart@nasa.gov,"Walkowicz, Lucianne M; Boyd, Patricia T.; Wakeford, Hannah R; Angerhausen, Daniel; Saxena, Prabal; Kostov, Veselin; Placek, Ben",Measuring Stellar Activity of Exoplanet Candidate Host Stars,"Direct measurements of the fundamental properties of stars (e.g. radius, rotation, mass, age) are critical for understanding stellar astrophysics. Rotation periods, in particular, provide important clues to the physics behind the formation and evolution of stars and subsequent planetary systems. When the latter are detected, studying the relation between the orbital period of the planet(s) and the rotation period of the parent star can also shed light on the spin-orbit alignment and on the angular momentum history of the system (e.g. Bouvier et al. 2013). In addition, stellar activity due to rotation and/or pulsations affects the measured radial velocity signature of the host star, and can even mimic inferred Keplerian motion. 

Prior to NASAs Kepler mission, stellar rotation was typically deduced from spectroscopy using the rotationally-broadened absorption line profiles. This technique, however, is both expensive in terms of telescope time, and more importantly, suffers from degeneracies stemming from its dependency on the a-priori unknown stellar radius and obliquity; it is also tailored to fast rotators. The mission has truly revolutionized the field, offering, for the first time, continuous monitoring of stellar flux allowing precise measurements of the rotation periods of tens of thousands of stars (e.g. McQuillan, Mazeh & Aigrain 2014). K2 builds up on this legacy, offering new opportunities to study stellar variability in a variety of settings  stars at the bottom of the main sequence, white dwarfs, binaries, stars in open clusters, etc (e.g. Kawaler 2014, Scholz et al. 2015, Rebel et al. 2016). 

Here we propose to observe 9 exoplanet-candidate host stars (1 transiting and 8 RV planets), study their long-term stellar activity and measure their photometrically-modulated rotation periods. Our targets span a range of stellar types (from K giants to M dwarfs), of planetary periods (from 3 days to 5 years) and masses/sizes (from ~2.5 REarth to ~10MJup). The rotation periods for six targets have been inferred from spectroscopically-measured vsin i (with various degree of confidence) and model-dependent radius. These periods range from 20 to 60 days  ideally suited for robust detection and confirmed by K2. For three of the targets the rotation periods are unknown. In addition, the nature of some of these candidates suffers from degeneracy between the measured radial velocities and inferred Keplerian motions. 

Our program will a) provide direct measurements for the rotation periods; b) break degeneracies between stellar rotation and exoplanetary orbits; and c) allow for comprehensive characterization of these systems. In combination with v sin i measurements (where available), our results will also allow model-independent measurements of the stellar radii. In addition, the observations will be sensitive to transits caused by additional exoplanets, and in the case of the one transiting planet  to transit timing variations. While there are ground-based photometric measurements for some of our targets, none of the available data compares to the precision, quality and uninterrupted monitoring of K2, making the observatory uniquely-suited for the proposed investigation. Thus our program will add to the growing legacy of stellar activity research enabled by the mission, provide input for gyrochronological studies, and offer new insight into the stellar astrophysics of these planet-hosting stars. The proposed study will directly support NASAs goal to Discover and study planets around other stars, in order to understand the underlying physical processes of exoplanets and to improve understanding of their origins."

Scientific Justification
We request K2 monitoring of unidentified and known X-ray sources in Campaigns 11 through 13, compiled from a variety of sources including the Chandra Source Catalog and the Million Quasar Catalog, to probe accretion onto compact objects at a variety of mass and time scales. Our KSwAGS survey found 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., 2015). Approximately half were active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various types (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring M-stars). A Kepler GO survey (PI: Still) of Chandra point sources resulted in a similar distribution of stars to active galaxies. High precision optical follow-up is scientifically useful for all sources; the AGN allow for a study of variability characteristics as a function of SMBH mass (Smith et al., 2015) and the stars allow for the study of a variety of rapid rotators and chromospheric activity (Howell et al., 2016). We received time for K2 to monitor KSwAGS sources in Field 4, and Field 8. This proposal has identical scientific goals and will continue the K2 optical monitoring of X-ray sources, but with target selection criteria that relies on archival X-ray observations only and not on new Swift pointings.

Previous AGN in the original Kepler field were selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012). These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 10^8 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum is dominated by starlight rather than AGN light (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2012). Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be constrained by a ~80-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks. This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk). This further monitoring will critically enhance the sample numbers of K2-monitored AGN discovered using a relatively unbiased selection method. We expect on the order of 100 targets in Fields 11 and 13, and about 60 in Field 12.

Methodology and Relevance to NASA Astrophysics Science Goals
We aim to use K2s impressive photometric precision to detect characteristic variability timescales using Fourier analysis. These timescales are the only possible direct observables of AGN accretion physics, which remains an important astrophysical mystery and directly addresses NASA Astrophysics goal to ""[d]iscover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars."".  Additionally, these X-ray selected targets will fill in the phase-space of black hole mass and accretion rate, complementing our work in the original Kepler field."
GO13087,13,Keivan,Guadalupe,Stassun,Vanderbilt University,keivan.stassun@vanderbilt.edu,"Boyd, Patricia T.; Vega, Laura Daniela; Montez, Rodolfo",Understanding the Mysterious RV Tau Phenomenon with K2,"Long after low- to intermediate-mass stars (1-8 Msun) leave the main sequence and reside in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, they experience huge amounts of mass loss reaching rates up to 10^{-4} Msun/yr that eventually shape to spherically symmetric shells of gas and dust around the hot core further create planetary nebulae (PN). However observations show PN morphologies to be diverse and asymmetric challenging the interpretation that PN come from single star systems. Consequently requiring that the majority of PN originate from binary star systems. We propose to confirm this condition by seeking to study the evolutionary status and properties of the poorly studied RV Tauri (RV Tau) variable stars that are thought to be the missing link between post-AGB and PN. 
RV Tau variable stars have been studied for more than 75 years yet they still remain a mystery. The physics behind these stars make them exhibit unique photometric variation in their light curves of alternating deep and shallow minima. These variations are thought to be associated to the instability of the star that leads to radial pulsations. These strange stars are very luminous (~1000 Lsun) with temperatures of 4000-6000 K or spectral classes from G to K. Jura (1986) identified RV Tau stars as post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) objects due to their high luminosity, mass-loss history, and large infrared excess due to circumstellar dust. However, it is not yet understood if RV Tau stars are a peculiar or a common phase in stellar evolution. Infrared excesses in the RV Tau stars' spectral energy distributions indicate the presence of circumstellar discs that might be due to accretion from a companion star. Thus RV Tau stars might provide clues on the evolution of binary systems. De Marco (2009) suggested that the asymmetric morphology found in the majority of planetary nebulae is probably due to binarity. This suggests that the short-lived poorly-studied RV Tau phase may predict a missing intermediate link between stars in the AGB phase and a planetary nebula phase (Willson & Templeton 2009). Hence, the RV Tau phase might represent the intermediate phase of stellar evolution for binary stars and thus, progenitors of planetary nebulae.

Initial Progress with Kepler:

Our goal is to better understand these stars and determine their place in the context of stellar evolution in order to confirm if they are in fact post-AGB successors and PN progenitors. In our preliminary analysis (Vega et al. 2016, in prep.) we use DF Cyg in the the original Kepler data as a test case to investigate the origin of RV Tau stars. Kepler has obtained the highest-precision light curve of any RV Tau star to date with ~4 yr of nearly continuous data. The Kepler light curve of DF Cyg reveals the RVa periodic variations of the light curve in unprecedented detail. We plan to establish what types of physical processes can make such a signature. We measured the arrival times of the deep and shallow minima. They seem to be consistent with a ~50-d period showing a linear trend across time. We are using the minima arrival times as a ""clock"" to further explain a long-term variation exhibited by DF Cyg. The residuals of this linear trend display that the minima arrival times are progressively coming in a day or two late for ~700-d duration, then they shift back to their stable arrival time. We argue that this is due to a secondary star disrupting these minima arrival times at closest approach to the primary. 

Proposed Observations with K2 Cycle 4:

There are 159 semi-regular and post-AGB objects identified from the cross-matched EPIC-Simbad catalog in Campaigns 11-13 (the majority in Campaign 11), which could be suitable RV Tau candidates. We plan to use similar techniques as Hartig et al. (2014) for correcting the data. We also plan to use the ""cotrending"" technique to remove instrumental effects while preserving the astrophysical signals at short periods."
GO13090,13,Joseph,Paul,Glaser,Drexel University,jpg84@drexel.edu,"McMillan, Stephen L. W; Geller, Aaron M",Search for Exoplanets Around Low-Mass Stars in Open Clusters,"Recent surveys exploring nearby open clusters have netted little to no exoplanet detections. This is surprising, as it is widely accepted that a majority of stars form within clustered environments before dispersing throughout the galaxy. The cause of this deficit in the planetary population is not well understood. Though the dynamical effects of star-star scattering had been used to explain this discrepancy in the past, previous surveys' observational statistics and detection biases can also be used to argue that the open cluster planet population is indistinguishable from the field planet population. 

We purpose to utilize the unique set of tools provided by the Kepler spacecraft to study a set of open clusters that reside within the Campaign 13 field. Specifically, our target list is primarily focused on cool, low-mass stellar candidates whose planetary companions remain difficult to detect with ground-based observations. These stars are of great interest as their cool temperatures and lower probability of hot Jupiter companions theoretically increase the possibility of dynamically stable Super Earths developing within the habitable zone. Any resulting detections will allow us to study the architectures of planetary systems in and, by comparison, out of clusters in search of various signatures of dynamical interactions, thereby improving our understanding of the currently diverse detected planet population. In addition, these observations will provide key physical constraints on multi-scale simulation work currently underway by our group to study planetary dynamics within clustered environments."
GO13094,13,Michael,Thomas,Carini,Western Kentucky University,mike.carini@wku.edu,,Rapid Optical Variability in Infrared and Optically Bright blazars,"Blazars are extreme examples of the phenomena known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak or completely absent discrete spectral features leaves us with only continuum variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F11, F12 and F13 field of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of blazars with Kep magnitude < 18 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip (WIBRaLS) that are not previously identified blazars. The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of tens of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density on timescales from tens of minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to lengthen the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies. This is a continuation of a program started in K2 Cycle 1. Our results so far show that the observed variability is characterized by linear trends with timescales of tens of days at the 5-20% level with shorter timescale, smaller discrete events and/or changes in slope present. A minority of sources display more complicated, violent variability behavior. A PSD analysis revealed PSD slopes in the range of -1.2 to -3.03, consistent with what is generally seen in blazar light curves."
GO13095,13,Geraldine,J,Peters,University of Southern California,gjpeters@mucen.usc.edu,"Wilson, R. E.",Gas Stream and Spot Dynamics in Early-Type Interacting Binary Systems,"We propose Long Cadence K2 photometry of 42 binaries with Algol-type light curves in Campaign Fields 11 and 13 to study gas stream impact and spot dynamics that influence the evolution of these systems. Most early-type stars begin as binary or multiple star systems, so an understanding the evolution of the Algol systems is critical for a more general knowledge of massive star and galactic evolution. The K2 mission and the modeling capabilities of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary system analysis program present a unique opportunity to probe gas stream dynamics and/or magnetic activity from the recently discovered quadrature brightness variations in Algol binaries that we call L/T variables. L/T is the flux ratio between the Leading and Trailing hemispheres on the primary star. The L/T phenomenon was discovered in Kepler data and has never been reported in ground-based photometry. L/T behavior is likely due to changes in either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the impact site's location and movement can be diagnostic of stream dynamics that may be modulated by magnetic fields. In the cool spot scenario the variability is a consequence of magnetic activity on the mass loser. In K2 Cycle 4 we are extending our study to close eclipsing systems with periods less than 1.0 day to investigate whether enhanced tidal interaction has influence on the L/T ratio and behavior. The Kepler and K2 databases are deficient in observations of very short-period Algols.  New data from Cycle 4 will improve our statistical study of the percentage of Algols that show L/T inequality and indicate whether there is a preference for L > T or the reverse.   Modeling the K2 light curves with the WD program, stellar and spot parameters, including spot motions, will be determined so as to generate a virtual image of the binary versus time. The updated WD program will be made available for future applications by others working with the Kepler/K2 databases."

This proposal follows similar ones we submitted for K2 campaigns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, for which we got awarded (GO: 0073, 1034, 3064, 4105, 5105, 6033, 7033). Even though many eclipsing binaries were observed by Kepler, almost none were done at short cadence, which prevented from detecting solar-like oscillations of systems composed of main-sequence and sub-giant stars. The main purpose of this series of proposals is to access such kind of systems. 

Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. As illustrated by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, asteroseismology is an efficient method to measure masses, radii, and ages of large numbers of stars, which is of prime importance to test stellar evolution. However, a crucial test of both asteroseismic masses and radii of a large sample of stars with independent measurements of those quantities has not yet been carried out. Eclipsing binary systems (EBs) potentially permit such an exercise by allowing for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, provided that spectral lines are detectable for both components. EBs are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough (e.g. Gaulme et al. 2014). 

So far, all published stars known to both display solar-like oscillations and belong to EBs are red-giants (RGs), and all have been detected by the Kepler mission. The first detection was the 408-day period system KIC 8410637 (Hekker et al. 2010, Frandsen et al. 2013). Since then, Gaulme et al. (2013 & 2014) reported a list 18 RG eclipsing-binary (RG/EB) candidates, of which 14 displayed oscillations. Beck et al. (2014 & 2015) reported the discovery of 18 stars with tidally excited pulsations (``heartbeat''), where each system has a RG component with oscillations, and three are also EBs. Two of these systems, KIC 8410637 and 9246715 have been completely characterized by combining photometry and radial velocities (Frandsen et al. 2013, Rawls et al. 2016). Both show a fairly good agreement between asteroseismic and photo-dynamical estimates of surface gravity and mean density, even though (Huber et al. 2014) contested the agreement regarding KIC  8410637. Provided that oscillations are detected, observing known EBs with K2 is a unique opportunity to extend the sample of systems to test asteroseismology. 

The purpose of this GO proposal is to observe a small set (maximum 6 per field) of eclipsing binaries that are already well characterized in terms of physical parameters (orbits, masses, radii). Doing so present two main advantages. Firstly, observing well-known systems helps predicting the likelihood of detecting solar-like oscillations. Secondly, the objective is to optimally focus our available resources for ground-based follow-up observations on the most rewarding targets. High-resolution spectroscopy is very time consuming, when one is aiming for precise radial velocities and high signal-to-noise data that serves as input for spectral-disentangling techniques. 

Funding will be requested to pay a graduate student for a 1-year and two trips to Europe, where most of the asteroseismic conferences/workshops are held.

The field has transformed from simple identification to comprehensive categorization and characterization of exoplanets and exoplanetary systems. Analyses of data provided by the NASA's Kepler mission has revolutionized this field by compiling a statistically significant number of transiting planets and planetary candidates, providing time series data for a large sample of systems that can be utilized in consistent comparative studies (e.g. Angerhausen et al., 2015). 

One promising new way to further characterize some of these transiting systems are methods using ground-based multi-object spectrographs for transit and eclipse spectrophotometry such as GMOS in the optical (e.g. Stevenson et al., 2014; Huitson et al., 2016, in prep.) or MOSFIRE in the infrared (e.g. Crossfield et al., 2013; Morris et al, 2016, in prep.). These emerging ground-based methods allow access to larger apertures and better time-sampling of transit lightcurves than equivalent HST methods. They therefore have the potential to observe transits at the precisions achievable from space but at a fraction of the cost and with the possibility of repeated measurements to further increase reliability. Importantly, ground-based telescopes have access to the full optical wavelength range and so will be highly complementary to JWST.

However, these ground-based methods are constrained by the need for similarly bright comparison stars in close neighborhood to the observed host star of the transiting system. In order to reduce instrumental systematics and optimize the time-sampling at the level needed for high-precision transit atmosphere observations, the comparison stars must be bright, of similar magnitude to the exoplanet host star and be within a few arcmin. 

To identify ideal candidates for ground-based characterization studies, we therefore we propose to use the single, visible wavelength instrument on board of K2 to obtain high-precision long cadence photometry on of the best suited pairs of similarly bright stars (mag < 11.5, separation < 5 arcmin). Assuming an occurrence of well-vetted planet candidates with P d 30 d of about ~2%, we expect to find ~20 planets that will be accessible for spectrophotometric atmospheric characterization from the ground.

The goal of high precision time resolved photometry is to reduce or in the best case remove all noise to achieve photon-noise limited photometry. After years of experience with these data a number of best practices for their handling have emerged: For the reduction and preparation of K2 data as well as for the planet search in the reduced data, we have access to a number of standard procedures that are already widely used in the community (e.g. the PyKe tools, Barclay & Still 2012; K2 specific best practices, Foreman-Mackey et al. 2015; or SIP, Angus et al. 2015). 

Finding these extremely valuable targets will enable us to do exactly the kind of basic research that advances our knowledge by characterization of planets and planetary systems outside of our Solar System in order to determine their compositions, dynamics, energetics, and chemical behaviors. The proposed study will directly support NASAs goal to Discover and study planets around other stars, in order to understand the underlying physical processes of exoplanets and to improve understanding of their origins.

GO13101,13,Douglas,Russell,Gies,Georgia State University,gies@chara.gsu.edu,,A K2 Survey of Hot Massive Stars during Campaigns C11 and C13,"Introduction:
The NASA Kepler mission was a huge success for exoplanet detection and stellar astronomy. We obtained magnificent 
time series data that have led to remarkable new studies especially in the areas of asteroseismology, stellar 
rotational modulation, and binary and multiple stars. However, the Kepler field of view was selected away from the 
Galactic plane to avoid problems with blending in the crowded star fields close to the plane. Because the massive stars 
are generally young and form in the Galactic plane, the selection of a FOV away from the plane meant that very few massive 
stars were measured by Kepler (no O-type stars, for example). Now with K2 we have the opportunity to remedy the situation 
and follow the light curves of a significant sample of massive stars. First observations occurred during campaigns 
C0, C4, and C7, and now in C11 and C13, the K2 FOV is again located close to the galactic plane, so that massive star
targets are accessible.  This proposal describes the massive star sample and the kinds of scientific investigations that 
would be possible through such K2 photometric observations.

Sample:
I selected stars from the ""Catalogue of Stellar Spectral Classifications"" (Skiff, 2009-2014) that is available from
CDS Vizier.  A total of 176 and 27 targets were selected that are within the nominal boresight coordinates for C11 and 
C13, respectively, and confirmed to fall on the CCD detectors using the K2fov program. These stars have magnitudes in the
range V = 8 to 12.  They comprise a diverse collection of young stars, mainly of spectral types O and B and spanning 
all luminosity classes. The group includes a number of the rapidly rotating Be stars that eject gas into a circumstellar 
disk.  All these stars are ideal long cadence targets for continuous temporal coverage during the C11 and C13 campaigns, 
and we plan to obtain contemporaneous spectroscopy of them.

Eclipsing Binaries and Exoplanets:
Massive stars are rare, and consequently there are relatively few with well-established masses from combined spectroscopic 
and photometric analysis (Torres et al. 2010, A&ARv, 18, 67 note only four eclipsing systems containing O-type stars in 
their compendium of accurate eclipsing binary results).  Consequently, the identification of new eclipsing binaries 
would offer us important new targets for the determination of fundamental parameters. In addition, massive stars are 
often found in multiple systems, and the survey would help determine the incidence of massive stars with eclipsing 
binary companions. There are several known exoplanets that orbit host B-type stars, and the C11 and C13 campaigns offer
a superb opportunity to search for transiting planets that managed to form in the energetic radiation fields of the 
hot host stars.

Asteroseismology:
The early-type pulsating stars include the beta Cep class (p-mode), slowly pulsating B stars (g-mode), and periodically 
variable B and A-type supergiants. These pulsations are important probes of stellar interiors. The K2 sample will 
determine the incidence of pulsations and how multiple-mode beating may play a role in the gas ejection processes that 
lead to disk formation in the emission line Be stars.

Magnetic Fields and Rotational Modulation:
Massive stars generally have convective cores and radiative envelopes that are not usually associated with magnetic 
dynamos and field generation. Nevertheless, sensitive polarimetric surveys like the MiMeS project have led to the 
detection of magnetic fields in about 10% of the OB-stars. In these cases, the magnetic field can produce spots that 
introduce a rotational modulation in the light curve. The K2 survey will help determine the frequency of such 
rotational modulations and will provide a sample large enough to study the kinds of stellar parameters that are 
associated with magnetic fields."
GO13103,13,Jennifer,,Patience,ASU,jennifer.patience@asu.edu,"De Rosa, Robert John; Aguilar, Jonathan A; Nielsen, Eric L; Greenbaum, Alexandra; Bastien, Fabienne Anne",K2 Monitoring Direct of Direct Imaging Planet Search Survey Stars,"We propose to use NASAs K2 to monitor 14 stars selected from ground-based direct imaging surveys that fall in Campaigns 11, 12, 13, in order to measure variations that result from rotation of surface features, stellar flares, and seismic activity. Direct imaging surveys target young stars that are good candidates for hosting gas giant planets at 10s of AU separation and protoplanetary or debris disks. The stars in our sample are chosen from GPIES (Macintosh et al. 2013), SPHERE (Bezuit et al. 2008), NICI (Wahaj et al. 2013, Nielsen et al., 2013, Biller et al., 2013), and SEEDS (Brandt et al. 2014) public target lists. They have been age-dated primarily by lithium, placement on the HR diagram, or by association to moving groups at young ages. 

The inferred properties of planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions discovered through direct imaging are often model dependent (e.g. Burrows et al. 1997, Baraffe et al. 2003), relying heavily on their age estimates. Identifying older systems that appear young from other estimates will improve the analysis of any circumstellar material (including companions), as well as survey statistics regarding the overall population and formation trends of long-period planets. Additionally, the stellar magnetic field environment can affect orbit evolution of companions as well as dust grain properties in disks. The stellar properties of direct imaging targets are an important component of understanding planet forming populations. 

Our program has three major goals, (1) to find potentially misidentified stellar ages in our sample through asteroseismology, (2) to measure stellar rotation periods to combine with radial velocity measurements from other facilities, and (3) to detect stellar flares in order to better understand the circumstellar environments where planets form and disks evolve. As more direct imaging target stars are monitored with K2, comparing their existing age estimates with newly measured rotational properties can help to explain angular momentum loss in young stars that may host planets. 

We propose short cadence observations in order to detect variations due to seismic activity and resolve detailed morphology of stellar flares. These observations will also provide rotational periods for each of our targets. Combining rotation rates with vsini measurements will resolve the inclination of the stellar axis for systems with potential planetary mass companions and/or disks. Measuring flaring properties of the stars in our sample will indicate the magnetic fields present in the circumstellar region, which is an important component to fully understanding the planet formation process. Finally, asteroseismology may be able to identify stars that are older than other age-dating methods have suggested."
GO13109,13,Bram,D,Buysschaert,"Institute for Astronomy, KU Leuven",bram.buysschaert@ster.kuleuven.be,"Aerts, Conny Clara; Neiner, Coralie; Oksala, Mary Elizabeth; Briquet, Maryline",K2 Asteroseismology of hot magnetic stars,"About 10% of hot stars host a magnetic field at their stellar surface, detectable with current ground-based spectropolarimeters (Grunhut & Neiner 2015,IAUS,305,53). The interaction of these fields with certain layers deep inside the star and influence internal physical processes is poorly understood, and can alter the efficiency of the internal mixing of chemical species or have a crucial role in angular momentum transport. Therefore, magnetic fields are important for the stellar structure and evolution of a significant number of hot stars.

We thus use asteroseismology to probe the stellar interior by studying their stellar pulsations. Tremendous progress in asteroseismology has been made over the last decade, with space-based missions providing a vast amount of data, and significantly improved seismic techniques. However, the number of hot magnetic pulsators studied with high precision space-based photometry is limited.

Theoretically, magnetic Ap/Bp stars should exhibit various pulsational behaviours (see Aerts et al. 2010, Springer, for a detailed overview). Bp and late A stars host heat-driven gravity modes, SPB and gamma Dor pulsators, respectively, probing the core region of the star. Pulsating early A stars are either classified as roAp stars or as delta Sct pulsators, which probe the outer regions of the star. The former exhibit high-order stochastic magneto-acoustic modes, while the latter have low-order pressure modes. Those heat-driven modes, observed with a high precision thanks to the long timebase, are necessary to perform successful seismic and stellar modelling, inferring the connection between stellar magnetic fields and their internal properties.

The magnetic fields observed in 10% of hot stars, and in particular in all Ap/Bp stars, are of fossil origin, i.e. remnants from the magnetic field of the original molecular cloud from which the star formed, possibly enhanced by a dynamo during the very early stages of stellar evolution. These fields have a simple configuration, most often a dipole inclined to the rotation axis. Magnetic fields are also responsible for peculiar chemical surface abundances. Combining magnetic information with a seismic study enables us to put strong constraints on stellar models, providing information about the stellar surface, through the magnetic study and the deep interior through asteroseismology. Moreover, comparing the amount of mixing obtained by asteroseismology for magnetic hot stars with that of non-magnetic objects would allow us to corroborate or disprove the theoretical prediction that magnetic fields inhibit mixing in stellar interiors.

At present, only two magnetic pulsating stars have been studied in such a detailed manner, beta Cep (Shibahasi & Aerts 2000,ApJ,531,L143) and V2052 Oph (Briquet et al. 2012,MNRAS,27,483). Although magnetic fields have been detected in a number of other pulsating stars, there has been no detailed seismic modelling, due to the current lack of either asteroseismic data for those stars or modelling of their magnetic field with this proposal, we aim to increase better understand how the stellar magnetic field influences non-standard mixing processes governing the interior of hot stars. Moreover, by combining this study with other K2 campaigns, we will reach a statistically significant number of hot magnetic stars.

The photometric accuracy and the high duty-cycle of K2 is best suited to reach our science goals. State-of-the-art modelling tools will translate seismic information to detailed stellar models. Spectropolarimetric observations will be obtained with ESPaDOnS or Narval. In total, 14 hot magnetic stars are observable in Fields 11 to 13. Although the proposed targets might show variability on short timescales, we can work with long cadence data to study the low order p modes and all possible g modes, as demonstrated by Saio et al.2015 (MNRAS,444,3264)."

Space data of these crucial objects have led to a giant leap forward in our understanding of their structure and evolution through the discovery of new dynamical phenomena. Moreover, insight into these stars dynamics is of crucial importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond.
Throughout the K2 Mission we have been building up a unique database of high precision RR Lyrae light curves from field to field, covering different parts of our Galaxy, and beyond. Our strategy assures that galactic structure studies and statistical analysis of pulsation properties (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko modulation, period doubling, low-dimensional chaos, non-radial modes) based on K2 data will be possible. Besides the ensemble studies, the boutique analysis of individual stars will be equally interesting and important. 

Targets
---------
Field 11 covers parts of the bulge where tens of thousands of RR Lyrae stars reside. For this proposal we selected about 1200 stars based on the OGLE-IV survey and an additional 400 stars from other sources covering the rest of the field of view. The OGLE survey discovered many stars with peculiar pulsation and modulation properties. Low-amplitude additional modes have been observed in all RR Lyrae subtypes, but their origins and occurrence rates are still largely unknown. We also included modulated RRc stars in the list. While the Blazhko effect in fundamental-mode stars has been studied extensively from space, the sample of modulated RRc stars is still scarce.  

In Field 12 we selected about 200 stars. 8 RR Lyrae stars were previously observed during the K2-E2 Engineering Test run, including a fundamental-mode star where we tentatively identified a frequency component as a g-mode signal. Re-observation of these targets present a unique opportunity to reassess our earlier findings that were based on only 9 days of data. It will also show us how did the accuracy of Kepler evolve since the early tests.  
For a number of RR Lyrae stars extensive multicolor photometry is available from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Field survey. The detailed color information will be a valuable addition to the K2 light curves. Beside the RR Lyrae stars, we also found an additional 30 variables belonging to various classes that we also include in this proposal.   

Field 13, towards the Galactic anticenter direction, contains 103 known RR Lyrae stars. One priority target here is BR Tau that has a short modulation period of only ~19 days. 

Methods and planned community resources
---------------------------------------------------
Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. Metallicities will be derived from empirical relations calibrated with high-resolution spectra. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations.
Photometry of large-amplitude pulsators require special treatment, and general-purpose pipelines may provide RR Lyrae light curves with sub-optimal quality. We already released tailor-made photometry from some Kepler data sets. We intend to create custom light curves for the stars listed in this proposal too, and plan to employ special methods like differential-image photometry for the bulge field. As a value-added community resource we envisage a searchable database containing the light curves, frequency solutions and other parameters (Blazhko periods, additional modes, etc.) of the RR Lyrae stars observed by K2."
GO13112,13,Coralie,,Neiner,Observatoire de Paris-Meudon,coralie.neiner@obspm.fr,"Saio, Hideyuki; Oksala, Mary Elizabeth; Mathis, Stephane; Lee, Umin; Buysschaert, Bram D",Understanding classical Be stars thanks to K2_x005F_x005Fs Fields 11 and 13,"Classical Be stars are rapidly-rotating pulsating hot stars that host a circumstellar disk created from matter ejected by the star through sporadic events. How these ejections occur is not understood yet, but they are most likely related to the very rapid stellar rotation and their pulsations. The correlation between pulsations and the ejections of matter was first proposed by Rivinius et al. (2001) and firmly established by Huat et al. (2009) thanks to CoRoT observations.
CoRoT observed a few bright Be stars and allowed us to progress significantly on this issue. In particular, sub-inertial gravito-inertial (gi) modes, which are stochastically-excited in the convective core, have been detected in HD51452 (Neiner et al. 2012). In addition, stochastically-excited low-frequency g modes have been observed with CoRoT in HD49330 during an outburst (Huat et al. 2009). These g modes are only visible during the outburst and probably excited just below the surface, while the kappa-driven p modes get destabilized at that time. It was not expected that stochastically-excited gi modes could be observed in hot stars (Samadi et al. 2010). However, Be stars are very rapid rotators and stochastic excitation is enhanced by rapid rotation, through the Coriolis acceleration. This has been demonstrated analytically (Mathis et al. 2014) and observed in numerical simulations (Rogers et al. 2013). Such stochastic modes are thus probably present in all rapidly rotating hot stars.
In addition, Lee (2013) showed that gi modes excited by the kappa mechanism transport angular momentum and could play a role in the Be phenomenon. Our recent work shows that transport by trapped sub-inertial waves may be sustained in rapidly rotating stars thanks to the stronger stochastic excitation by turbulent convective flows. Moreover, sub-inertial gi modes have very low frequencies and therefore they transport more angular momentum than modes with higher frequencies. We thus proposed that this mechanism allows to transport angular momentum from the convective core of Be stars to their surface. The accumulation of angular momentum just below the surface of Be stars increases the surface velocity, which then reaches the critical velocity needed to eject material from the star (Neiner et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2015).
Unfortunately, the nominal Kepler mission did not observe classical Be stars and only 14 Be stars were observed so far in K2 fields. We propose to observe the additional 4 classical Be stars available in Fields 11 and 13, in long cadence mode. We have already developed tools to construct light-curves from the provided pixel data and to correct for any remaining effects of the roll of the satellite (Buysschaert et al. 2015). The data of previous fields are currently being analyzed and will be combined with the Fields 11-13 data, to test the scenario devised from CoRoT observations.
Our first goal is to investigate whether the observed classical Be stars show stochastic gi modes in addition to the kappa-driven g and p pulsation modes, to confirm that these gi modes are common in Be stars and are a signature of the Be phenomenon. Second, we will apply the seismic modelling tool we recently developed to model the kappa-driven and stochastic gi modes. We will then be able to compute the transport of angular momentum from the core of the Be stars to their surface. If this angular momentum transport is sufficient, it would confirm our proposed scenario that gi modes are those that enhance the transport of momentum, leading the surface layer to reach critical velocity and thus igniting the ejection of material to the Keplerian circumstellar disk.
In addition, for 2 Be stars observed with CoRoT it has been possible to derive the extent of the convective core (Neiner et al. 2012). This is very important to quantify the effect of rapid rotation on the internal structure of stars. We expect that this will also be possible for most classical Be stars observed with K2."
GO13113,13,Ehsan,,Moravveji,KU Leuven,Ehsan.Moravveji@ster.kuleuven.be,"Pollard, Karen Rylvia; de Mink, Selma E; Sana, Hugues AA; Aerts, Conny Clara; Moya, Andy; Simon-Diaz, Sergio; Castro, Norberto; Buysschaert, Bram D; Kambe, Eiji; Saio, Hideyuki",UPBEAT: Unravelling Pulsations of BluE supergiAnTs,"Introduction. Blue Supergiant (BSG) stars are early-type massive (>3 Msun) stars found at their post-main sequence evolution phase. Due to their impact on galactic evolution (triggering starburst, and metal enrichment) they are critical objects to study. Several physical aspect of BSG evolution is still poorly understood; specifically, there is no clear census of binarity among BSGs. As young objects, they reside predominantly in the Galactic plane. Surface He and CNO abundances in BSGs exhibit a significant excess compared to their main sequence progenitors, rendering the rotational mixing a plausible explanation (Przybilla et al. 2010, A&A). BSGs exhibit photometric and spectroscopic variabilities (see Moravveji et al. 2012a, ApJ, for an example) due to radial/nonradial oscillations, episodic mass loss (Aerts et al. 2010, A&ALett), rotating spot(s) at the photosphere, and/or ellipsoidal variability possibly due to the presence of a close companion. UPBEAT aims to characterise and quantify these variability mechanisms involved in Galactic BSGs by combining K2 space photometry with time-resolved ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy.

Feasibility. The K2 photometry of 10 BSGs in the engineering Field 0 proved that this instrument is capable of detecting BSG varibilities. Thus, the unique capabilities of K2 is well suited for our proposed project. The Campaign 0 provided only ~30 days of useful data for asteroseismic purposes (see e.g. Buysschaert et al. 2015, MNRAS). This limitation is improved by the instrument pointing stability and the ~80 day contiguous observations since Field 2. Thus, the resulting light curves will not suffer from daily aliasing, and is quite optimal for characterization of BSG variabilities. The K2's point-to-point photometric scatter is ~50 ppm. Based on our experience with BSGs in Campaign 0, K2 photometry is precise enough to characterise and quantify flux variability due to different underlying reasons. Thus, UPBEAT can feasibly exploit K2's capabilities.

Impact. During Campaign 11, K2 visits the Galactic plane (maybe for the last time). This is a unique and time-critical opportunity, because the next planned mission to deliver such high-quality uninterrupted space photometry is PLATO, to be launched after ~2024. The ~8 year observation gap between now and 2024 can only be filled with K2. Space photometry of BSGs, at the precision and cadence offered by K2, is scarce; thus, K2 will leave a valuable legacy data behind for scrutinizing the physics of the upper Herzsprung-Russel diagram for the next decade(s). UPBEAT seizes this opportunity by focusing on a sample of Galactic BSGs.

Objectives. We have already proposed 38 BSGs for the Campaign 9 (DDT); by the time we are submitting this proposal, we are still unaware of the NASA/K2 peer-review decision. Here, we propose observation of additional 40 OB-type BSGs between Kp=8 and 16 magnitude in fields 11, 12 and 13. We guarantee high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy with HERMES@Mercator for targets with Kp <12, and spectroscopic monitoring for those brighter than Kp ~10 mag. We will use other instruments (UVES@VLT and/or HDS@Subaru) for targets fainter than Kp ~12 mag. The combined photometry and spectroscopy will be used to (a) identify or exclude pulsation variability, (b) draw the observational instability strips, and confront that with our predictions (Moravveji 2016, MNRAS) (c) explore the pulsation excitation mechanism (epsilon- versus kappa-mechanism, Moravveji et al. 2012b, ApJ). (d) carry out iterative frequency prewhitening, and search for regularities in frequency and/or periods, (e) characterize possible rotating spots, (f) test the hypothesis that macroturbulence velocity has pulsation origin, (g) trace the surface chemical and rotational velocity evolution, with a possible link to rotational and/or non-rotational mixing processes, and (h) disentangle apparent single stars versus close binaries."
GO13114,13,Andras,,Pal,MTA CsFK,apal@szofi.net,"Szabo, Robert; Mueller, Thomas G; Kiss, Laszlo; Kiss, Csaba",K2 photometry of a large sample of trans-Neptunian objects,"Our recent studies (Pal et al. 2015, 2016, Kiss et al 2016) have demonstrated that the K2 mission is an excellent opportunity to obtain rotational properties of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Using long-cadence Kepler photometry focusing on the stationary points of the apparent tracks of these objects, light curves with excellent quality can be obtained, from which one can constrain the rotation period, surface inhomogeneities, the shape of the object and decide, whether the true rotation period corresponds to a single-peaked or double-peaked solution.

We propose to observe 13+9+9 Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects throughout the Campaigns 11, 12 and 13, respectively, of the K2 programme. From our list of proposed targets, 8 also have been observed in the framework of the ``TNOs are Cool!'' open-time key programme of the Herschel Space Observatory (Muller et al. 2009), therefore an unambiguous rotational characteristics can be combined with an unambiguous diameter and surface albedo for these objects. This sample of ours covers various dynamical types of the population of objects outside the main asteroid belt, including 5 Centaurs, 13 classical objects, 4 scattered disk objects and 9 resonant objects. One of the resonant objects has 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune (namely 2012 VU85, a Trojan of Neptune) as well as there are four Plutinos, i.e. objects in 2:3 mean-motion resonance with Neptune.

None of targets having Herschel/PACS thermal photometry have a currently known accurate rotation period (note: 2005 TB190 has ground-based observations confirming variability but with several aliases, see also Thirouin et al. 2012). Hence, the K2 time series also aids the proper interpretation of thermal emission measurements. All of the targets having Herschel photometry fall on silicon for quite long time (60+ days) with the exception of Borasisi. This object is a binary system with a period of 46.3 days (Noll et al. 2004). Hence, the total time of 13+10 days when K2 is capable to perform photometry would not cover the binary period, however, even this shorter track could confirm or constrain whether the objects have a synchronous rotation or not.

Due to the number of these targets and the comparatively large pixel cost w.r.t the stellar sources, we prioritize our targets according to their brightness (i.e. the effective S/N ratio of the rotational light curve) as well as the existence of thermal infrared data. Our top priority objects include all of the objects having Herschel/PACS photometry. We also indicated 2012 VU85 with priority 1. Priority 2 objects are either bright or have interesting dynamical properties. We note that even the faintest (priority 3) objects have comparable brightness to that of 2002 GV31. This object was also successfully observed by K2, yielding a folded light curve with good signal-to-noise ratio and an unambiguous rotation period (Pal et al. 2015). We also note that the first minor body discovered in the outer Solar System, (2060) Chiron fell on silicon during Campaign 12. Due to the different nature of K2 data acquisition, the science case of (2060) Chiron is described in a separate proposal.

Brightness fluctuations arise from starspots, flares, accretion, protoplanetary disk obscuration, and eclipses. Much effort over the past decades has been dedicated to connecting light curve features with stellar and circumstellar properties. Yet the nearest young stellar associations have traditionally been too spatially dispersed to obtain high quality light curves for more than a handful of stars. The K2 Mission is rectifying this situation with exquisite photometric datasets encompassing tens of degrees on the sky.  In Campaign 2, we monitored the ~10 Myr Upper Scorpius association. Now in Campaign 13, we propose to gather light curves for 215 members of ~1-Myr-old Taurus, arguably the best studied nearby star forming region. The envisioned combination of K2 light curves, ground-based spectroscopy and spectropolarimetery, as well as disk imaging will furnish a legacy dataset for years to come.  It will provide a valuable comparison to the preexisting Upper Sco data, since the youthful Taurus stars accrete more strongly and host more massive disks.

Our science program will consist of four intertwined aims: by gathering high-precision light curves for Taurus members, we will assess the rotation rate distribution in the context of other young clusters; identify and analyze pre-main-sequence eclipsing binaries; search for circumstellar obscuration events to learn about the inner protoplanetary disk; and correlate observed variability patterns with accretion and magnetic field geometry inferred from complementary spectropolarimetric observations. For each science goal, we will derive high-precision, systematic detrended light curves from K2 pipeline products, and we will classify the variability therein using established statistical metrics (e.g., Cody et al. 2014). Photometric amplitudes in the <1% to 100+% range are expected, with fluctuations on timescales from hours to weeks. K2 is therefore well suited to probing a wide range of physical phenomena associated with these young stars.

Once variability patterns have been identified, we will follow up with high resolution spectroscopy for eclipsing binaries or planetary transits, and spectropolarimetry (CFHT/ESPaDOnS; SPIROU) for stars with signatures of accretion bursts and/or photospheric spots.  Light curves with circumstellar extinction events will be compared with known properties from ongoing millimeter observations from ALMA. This work will establish stellar properties such as masses and radii, as well as illuminate the geometry of the inner disk and its connection to the central star. A better understanding of (circum-)stellar properties at this early epoch is in direct support of K2s goals to enhance our knowledge of stellar and planetary astrophysics. This work is relevant to several key science areas including planet detection and stellar variability."
GO13118,13,Guy,S.,Stringfellow,University of Colorado,Guy.Stringfellow@colorado.edu,,"The Star-Disk Interaction in Young Stars: Disentangling Accretion, Extinction, Rotation and Binarity","Eruptive phenomena associated with the formation of stars is believed to arise from enhanced mass accretion rates. Accretion is the normal process by which stars form. At later pre-main-sequence stages when the star is unveiled and the disk has formed, accretion involves the transfer of mass from the disk circumstellar disk accompanied by infall onto the central star typically funneled along magnetic field stream-lines anchored at opposite ends within the disk and the star. Accretion at some low level occurs in most (young) T Tauri stars with notable disks. However, there are times in some cases where the accretion rate increases substantially (by orders of magnitude); perhaps spurred by disk instabilities and/or by a companion in a multiple system. EXOrs are classical T Tauri stars that undergo such large increases in their mass accretion rates leading to major optical outbursts (_x005F_x005FV =3-5 mag). These eruptive outbursts last from months up to a few years. Another class of eruptive phenomena are the FUOrs, which are heavily obscured and do not display the emission line spectra that T Tauri stars do, instead having absorption F/G-supergiant type spectra during their extended outbursts; their outbursts decline slowly over many decades. EXOr outbursts produce a prodigious amount of UV and X-ray energy. This energy then bathes the circumstellar environment. Significant changes may result in the physical conditions of the circumstellar environment as a direct consequence of these outbursts; the surface of the circumstellar disk is heated, disk convection and mixing might be (further) stimulated, and modified disk chemistry may ensue. Such affects may modify when and where planets form in the disks of T Tauri stars. Thus, it is important to characterize these outbursts and understand why they occur and what their potential impact can be on the circumstellar environment. It is also important to fully characterize the quiescent state of T Tauri stars in order to contrast changes occurring post-outburst. 

K2 Campaign 13 encompasses a number of T Tauri stars, many of which are known accretors. Their study allows will enhance our understanding of the accretion process and its impact, particularly as it pertains to the formation of jets and outflows, and in the rare examples of accretion driven outbursts. Campaign 13 is particularly important in this regard as many of the Taurus T Tauri stars fall on silicon, and specifically includes two previously identified EXOrs known to have undergone outbursts in the past: VY Tau and DR Tau. VY Tau was very active during the decades preceding the 1970s, undergoing multiple short-duration eruptions. It then went into a dormant state for several decades, but in the last year has become active once again experiencing eruptions. DR Tau remains in an extended bright state though it is certainly not a FUOr type object.

We propose to observe these two stars, and a large number of other active T Tauri stars to study the accretion process and frequency/duration of accretion driven eruptions. Further, the resulting light curves will be analyzed for eclipsing companion stars, and extinction events caused by warped accretion disks. There are 92 in Campaign 13. As Taurus will be observable from the ground at the start of nights during the first third of K2 Campaign 13, supporting ground-based observations will be planned. The proposed observations may lay to rest, either through confirmation or refuting of the hypothesis that close binary companions are responsible for perturbing the accretion disk, resulting in the accretion driven eruptions in EXOrs. 

This program is relevant to NASA science goals of understanding how stars and planets form, their evolution, and the influence of the stars properties on the surrounding planetary environment and its influence on the origin of planet formation and life."

One of the best ways to understand when and how planets form is to look for planets around the youngest stars which are surrounded by protoplanetary disks and in the process of forming planets right now.  However, the large level of stellar and accretion related variability of these objects makes planet searches around these young stars very difficult.  The high accuracy and long term continuous cadence of K2 light curves of these young stars will greatly aid our understanding of the astrophysical signals that complicates planet searches around these new born stars.  We will also use the K2 light curves to enable additional science on jet launching and interacting magnetospheres in young stars."
GO13121,13,Thomas,S,Allen,Lowell Observatory,tallen@lowell.edu,"Prato, Lisa; Cody, Ann Marie",Determining the Properties of Young Stellar Binary Components,"We propose to observe 25 young, visual binary systems in Taurus during campaign 13 of the K2 mission.  Binary stars are important simply on the basis of their predominance.  Furthermore, they have long been important laboratories for stellar astrophysics.  For example, mapping a binarys orbit, spatially and spectroscopically, yields precise component masses and mass ratios.  Properties of the stars as a function of mass may then be determined, providing key data for stellar models.    The study of young stellar multiples is also important because of the potential impact of the binary environment on planet formation.  We have an ongoing observing program to determine the orbital parameters and simultaneously identify the stellar and circumstellar properties of ~100 young binary systems.  Our in-hand data includes high-resolution, infrared spectra of each component in most of the pairs in our sample, including systems with separations on the order of the diffraction limit of 8$-$10 meter class telescopes.

K2 time series photometry of these binary systems will provide crucial information for the study of component rotation periods, angular momentum evolution, and hence binary formation mechanisms.  We will determine component rotation periods through analysis of the multiple periodicities in the blended light curves for each star in the proposed 25 binary systems where possible.  For binaries of very unequal brightness, we will determine at least the rotation period of the primary star.  Combining estimates of stellar radii with vsini values, measured from our spectra, and K2 rotation periods, we will determine true rotational velocities and stellar inclinations.

K2 time series photometry will also allow for uninterrupted monitoring of the accretion signatures and resulting variability of the young systems with protoplanetary disks.  Finally, we will use the proposed photometry to search for transits from any undetected stellar, brown dwarf, or planet components that these systems may contain."

The first of our three objectives is construct catalogs of transiting planets in the magnitude-limited samples of K2 fields.  These catalogs enable diverse follow-up observations and analyses by our team and others.  Second, we aim to discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  Our third goal is to use the planet catalogs to measure variations in the occurrence rate of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood. We already see differences between the populations of planets orbiting nearby stars and stars in the prime Kepler Field.  For example, hot Jupiters are 2.5 times less abundant in the Kepler Field (Howard et al. 2012).  We have to wonder if the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone (Petigura et al. 2013) is similarly reduced relative to nearby stars. With this proposal we will measure the occurrence of detectable, short-period super-Earths and Neptune-size planets (~2-3 Earth-radii). 

This Cycle 4 request for Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in C0-C10 (PIs Howard, Sanchis-Ojeda, Petigura, and Winn) that constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.  We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts.  Here we request magnitude-limited samples (Kp < 14) of Fields 11-13 comprising approximately 10,000 stars per field.

We will continue our search for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013).  We catalog the planets discovered, their orbital and physical properties, and their host star characteristics.  We compute the occurrence rates of small, close-in planets using injection-and-recovery tests to account for the sensitivity of TERRA and will report the field-to-field variability and overall rates of planet occurrence. Assuming a precision of 80 ppm over 6.5 hours, a 2 Earth-radii planet with P = 20-day is detectable at SNR = 8 during a single 75-day K2 campaign.  Based on the prime mission occurrence statistics, we expect to find 3 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with P < 20 days per 1,000 stars observed. As validated by our searches of K2 photometry from Campaigns 0-2, a sample of 8,000 stars is expected to yield ~25 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with orbital periods less than 20 days, providing an occurrence measurement with 25% fractional uncertainty. With 8,000 stars, we will be sensitive to factor-of-two variations in the occurrence rate of 2-3 Earth-radii planets at 4-sigma significance.  In addition, we will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES and other facilities. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultra-short-period Earths. Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission."

astrophysics, and solving this will have significant ramifications for our understanding of how other galaxies form and evolve. Success
will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution.
This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the
solar neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used
Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential
for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.
RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar
samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program
for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to
those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.
AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (on average ~5000 per campaign) to
probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to
make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys
structure and evolution from its stellar populations.
METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by
ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use
our seismic inferred stellar properties to stresstest state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."
GO13127,13,Marcelo,,Emilio,University of Hawaii,marcelo_emilio@yahoo.com,"Armstrong, James D.; Andrade, Laerte; Rabello-Soares, Maria Cristina; Kuhn, Jeff R; Janot-Pacheco, Eduardo",Characterization of Be stars in the Kepler K2 fields,"1. Introduction
We propose the characterization of Be stars in K2 fields 11, 12 and 13. Classical Be stars are rapid rotators of spectral type B and luminosity class V-III which have an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk. The disk often exhibits Balmer emission lines and an infrared excess fed by discrete mass loss events called outbursts. In spite of their high V sin i, rapid rotation alone cannot explain
the ejection episodes as most Be stars do not rotate at their critical rotation rates. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations have been analyzed to demonstrate short-term variations are rather common among early-type Be stars. The observed line profile variability (LPV) is characterized by moving bumps traveling from blue to red across the line profile on timescales ranging from minutes to a few days. Non-radial pulsations (NRP) have been proposed as an explanation of the LPV observed in hot stars. NRP
produce LPV thanks to the combination of the Doppler displacement of stellar surface elements with their associated temperature variations due to the compression/expansion caused by the passage of waves through the photosphere. NRP could be the additional mechanism required for a rapidly rotating B star to become a Be star, that is to trigger the Be phenomenon by means of mass ejection (Rivinius et al. 1998).
2. High-precision photometry and pulsation periods.
Huat et al. (2009) found for the Be HD 49330 from CoRoT and ground-based spectroscopic data an increase in amplitude for g-modes and a decrease for p-modes just before an outburst. Neiner et al. (2012) discovered gravito-inertial modes in the Be star HD 51452. They found that the mode amplitudes were linked to the presence of mini outbursts. In general, hot Be stars display nonradial pressure pulsation modes, whereas cooler ones display gravity modes. Despite those empirical evidences, the physical processes responsible for the outbursts and mass loss in Be stars are still poorly understood. Dziembowski et al. (2007) showed that high-order g-modes driven by the kappa mechanism are unstable in the region of the HR diagram occupied by Be stars. The predicted radial velocity amplitude
due to an l=3 g-mode is ~ 20 km/s for a star with 4 solar masses, with pulsation periods in the range ~0.51.1 days. For more massive and hotter stars like HD 171219, unstable modes are found with periods of 0.5-2 days.
3. Methods and proposed targets
Pulsation analysis of a star requires the measurement of frequencies with both high photometric precision and high time-frequency resolution. Only space missions provide both conditions. Since NRP in Be stars have periods near 1.0 cycles per day, Kepler observations are especially important to avoid the frequency aliases due to the day/night cycle of ground observations. Another advantage of Kepler data is the continuous observations for months with a 30 min cadence that improves the chances to observe outburst events in our targets. Stellar seismology made a great leap forward thanks to the MOST, CoRoT and Kepler satellites.  Our targets have Kp between 4.4 and 15.7 Long cadence (30 min) is desirable for this research. We aim to have both Kepler photometric time-series and simultaneous ground spectroscopic observations in the first month of kepler observations to measure Be periodicities and understand the Be phenomenon. Our proposal fits the Small category, and the number of our targets will be under 300. Our group have experience with asteroseismology and have already worked in the same analysis with CoRoT data, and have targets been observed in K2 cycle 3.
4. Significance
Be stars, as easy-to-observe objects giving a privileged peek into the structure of rapidly rotating stars, are therefore among the best suited laboratories to investigate important problems in contemporary astrophysics, like the effects of rapid rotation on stellar evolution."

These systems will allow us to improve calibrations of the age-rotation-activity relationship for field stars across a wide range in age. Flare rates and rotation periods will be measured using previously developed toolkits, and this sample will add to the ongoing analysis of Kepler and K2 wide binary systems.

Stars lose angular momentum as they age, causing their rotation periods to decline at a predictable rate. This ""gyrochronology"" method provides us with a means to determine stellar ages to within ~10% for Sun-like stars (Barnes 2010 ApJ 722 222). Wide binary systems help to extend the usable mass and age range for gyrochronology, and will be able to test new models of weakened magnetic braking in old field stars (e.g. van Saders et al. 2016 Nature, 529, 181).  A subset of the proposed sample contains white dwarf components whose cooling ages provide a benchmark against which their main sequence companions rotation ages may be compared.

Because slower rotation weakens the internal magnetic dynamo, flare rates are predicted to decline over time. As a result, older stars like the Sun exhibit very few ""super flares"". The detailed evolution of flare rates for main sequence stars of spectral types G, K, and M is poorly constrained, however, due to the small number of flare stars with known ages. Any wide binary component with a measurable flare rate and rotation age is extremely valuable for such calibrations. These systems will also become important benchmarks for other facets of magnetic activity, such as tracking the evolution of activity cycles and starspot filling factors."

So far, stars brighter than Kp < 8 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 observations of the brightest stars in campaigns 14-16, including a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels. Asteroseismic studies of these targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations which will pave the way for the success of the K2 Galactic Archeology Program, and insights into poorly understood internal processes of intermediate-mass stars such as convective core overshooting.

We will select all targets with Kp < 8 mag from the Hipparcos catalog. We will use conventional apertures and small (~24 pixel diameter) circular apertures around the saturated core for very bright (Kp < 6) targets. For the latter, we will perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method (so-called halo photometry) has been demonstrated to detect pulsations for all bright Pleiades and Hyades stars observed in Campaign 4. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Our proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics, a key science goal of the K2 mission. Our project furthermore supports galactic astrophysics, another key science area identified in the NRA, through the calibration of scaling relations for galactic archeology studies. A better understanding of stellar models through the study of bright stars is relevant for science goals pursued by both present and future NASA missions such as the characterization of exoplanets (TESS, JWST) as well as stellar populations and galaxy formation/evolution (HST, JWST)."

Due to their diversity in fundamental properties (e.g. stellar masses), low-luminosity red-giant branch (LLRGB) stars are ideal targets to tackle two key unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of host star mass and evolutionary state, and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets. Our K2 program has already discovered the first potentially re-inflated Jupiter around an oscillating evolved star (Grunblatt et al. 2016), and preliminary results indicate an sharp transition in planet occurrence as a function of stellar evolution state. Here we propose to continue our survey in C14-C16 to detect additional planets needed to confirm these intriguing results.

We selected targets using Hipparcos and Gaia parallaxes, as well as spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, RAVE and LAMOST. The availability of Gaia parallaxes and the extensive coverage by LAMOST and RAVE will yield a significantly higher yield of bona-fide LLRGBs than in previous campaigns, making C14-C16 a particularly valuable sample to achieve our science goals. Planet candidates will be detected with K2 long-cadence data using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since LLRGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up high-precision radial velocity observations using Keck/HIRES and APF will be used to confirm the planets.

The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing LLRGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

1416 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M
Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate 100200 small planets around late-type stars from
the full K2-MDP program. This new population of planets will drastically increase the number
of known M dwarf planetary systems, improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet
formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current
and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected on the basis of high proper-motion, photometric colors, and
supplemented with GAIA data where feasible. Our approach captures the majority of M dwarfs
within 100pc of the Sun with little contamination. Our targets have median brightness Kp<15,
most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC. We prioritize our targets using expected transit
S/N, determined by comparing K2s precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting
super-Earth. We estimate transit depths by converting multiband to spectral type and then to R
and T ef f . Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel
data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts provide stellar
parameters. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization,
aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date.

The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward all our goals. Our collaboration
has resulted in nine papers published to date, with ten currently submitted or in preparation. Our
largest results are a full C04 candidate and validated planet catalog (Crossfield et al. 2016), papers
describing M dwarf stellar characterization and candidates (Martinez et al., submitted; Dressing et
al., submitted & in prep.). We have been awarded large, multisemester programs at ESO (for spec-
troscopic follow-up), Keck (for Radial Velocity masses), and Gemini (for AO and speckle imaging).

The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims to reveal
hundreds of small planets around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-
like planets and planets suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science
drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky
planets and key transit spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO)
leading up to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; well before the launch of TESS. We also
re-propose all candidates and validated planets identified by our team in C5 (Petigura et al. in prep;
Livingston et al. in prep), in order to more fully validate the remaining candidates and to measure
TTVs and more precise system parameters for the validated planets.

The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars need to be rotating slower than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 210 days.  The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that many, but by no means all, Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars.  Currently there are only three A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-57b). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars.  Using Kepler and K2, we have a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to: 
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binarity within the Am stars, 
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars.  Only 11 Am stars were observed during the Kepler mission. So far a further 100 have so far been observed with K2. For this proposal we have around 20 targets for Campaigns 14 to 16. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to in excess of 120.  The proposal team are experienced in the reduction of Kepler data using PyKE tools and in the analysis of time-varying photometry. We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary.  The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."

We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2, conducting reconnaissance spectroscopy, and ultimately gathering high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models.  This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small, and the properties of the systems to date don't adequately sample the desired range of planetary and stellar properties.  We propose a ranked list of 14,287 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We will generate this list by first searching for all moderately bright stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 14, 15, and 16, and then using the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. We also propose two targets, found to have planets in previous K2 campaigns, for short cadence observations.

We will identify planet candidates using the planet detection pipeline developed by our team members. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities.  The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 80 nights per year of guaranteed time per year. The follow-up of small planets from Kepler and K2 is the top scientific priority of HARPS-N.  We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. Our team has already delivered such products for previous K2 campaigns; in particular, our 446 K2 reconnaissance spectra are the only spectroscopic observations listed on ExoFOP-K2 as of 6 Dec 2016.

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a significant impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."

This will be achieved using short-cadence (SC) data collected during K2 Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 (C14-16). This proposal follows similar ones submitted for K2 campaigns 0-13 (PIs Chaplin, Campante, Davies, and Lund).

The information contained in solar-like oscillations allows the internal stellar structure to be constrained to unprecedented levels and allows precise determinations of fundamental stellar properties (mass, radius, age). We seek to exploit the unique opportunity offered by K2 to observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed during the nominal mission, thus benefiting from better independent constraints (parallaxes, spectroscopy, interferometry). This will make it possible to bring the full potential of asteroseismology to bear to test the physics of stellar interiors. To constrain our analysis further we plan for a spectroscopic follow-up of the proposed targets. By combining the targets observed 
during C14-16 with those from previous K2 campaigns that possess independent constraints we may calibrate seismic scaling relations. This will be essential in seismic galactic archaeology studies, which rely on the application of these relations. Including also targets from the nominal mission, we may study the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood and place constraints on the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars. The results will be used in ongoing investigations that are relevant to this solicitation: - In C16, M44 and M67 will be re-observed, allowing us to combine new observations with those made during C5, from which solar-like oscillations have been detected for both clusters. M44 is similar to the Hyades for which [1] from C4 observations provided the first ever detections of MS solar-like oscillators in an open cluster. C16 is furthermore forward facing, allowing for contemporaneous observations from the SONG network. Such observations are vital to better understand the relations between observations in photometry and velocity.   - The targets will further expand the sample of benchmark stars having precise fundamental properties from asteroseismology to different fields in the Galaxy, which will be crucial to calibrate surveys as Gaia and the upcoming GALAH.

We estimate requesting for 30-50 targets per campaign. These should show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes, hence SC data are required for detecting the oscillations. We will prepare analysis-ready light curves from pixel-data using in-house software - these will be made available to the community via the KASOC portal. We will apply well-tested analysis procedures to the frequency-power spectra of the light curves, providing both estimates of global seismic parameters and individual modes of oscillation. Detailed modelling using state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes will then provide the stellar properties.  The methodology delineated above has already been successfully applied to the analysis of K2 C1-8 data, for which we reached a very good understanding of the seismic detection yield - from targets awarded in C0-3, [2] showed a detection yield >73%. From C3-5 data we have found that solar-like oscillations can be detected for stars similar to the Sun, with characteristic frequencies around 3100uHz. We have also successfully extracted individual frequencies for these stars, hence enabling detailed seismic modelling [2].

GO14012,14,Philip,Steven,Muirhead,Boston University,philipm@bu.edu,"Skinner, Julie N",Activity and Planets at the Bottom of the Main-Sequence,"We propose to continue a K2 program to observe a carefully selected sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) with K2 during Campaigns 14, 15, and 16. UCDs occupy the transition from main-sequence stars to brown dwarfs (late-M and later) and are essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the lowest mass objects in the Universe. Historically, photometric monitoring of UCDs for transiting planets and rotational spot modulation has been hampered by their intrinsic faintness and the expected short duration of transit events. The K2 spacecraft provides an excellent opportunity to study these objects in more detail, thanks to the large aperture and near-continuous 80-day photometric coverage of each K2 field.  Searching for Transiting Planets Orbiting UCDs: The discovery of transiting planets (TRAPPIST-1) orbiting a UCD has had significant implications for the field of exoplanets.  However, the larger population of exoplanets around these small, cool objects remains unprobed and will provide important constraints on planet formation around the smallest dwarfs.  UCDs are small, all roughly the diameter of Jupiter, which implies deep fractional transit signatures. UCDs are also relatively bright in the infrared. A planet that transits a UCD, whether gaseous or rocky, would be an ideal target for near-infrared transit transmission spectroscopy, as has been successfully performed on super Earths orbiting mid-M dwarf stars with the Hubble Space Telescope. Future transit transmission observations with NASAs James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets, but only for those planets that transit ultra-cool dwarfs. The transits from rocky planets orbiting mid-M and earlier dwarf stars are simply not deep enough to search for biosignatures over the expected lifetime of JWST. Recent studies of short-period planet occurrence around early- and mid-M dwarfs show that lower mass stars have significantly more rocky short-period planets than Sun-like stars. Extrapolating to ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect a large fraction, if not all UCDs to harbor rocky planets with transit probabilities of ~10%.  Spot morphology at the M/L transition: Studies indicate that over 90% of UCDs show evidence of surface activity in the form of H± emission; however, the nature of the activity is not fully understood. Unlike sun-like stars, UCDs have fully convective interiors and are expected to have magnetic field morphologies markedly different from the Sun. With precise photometric monitoring of UCDs with K2 we will measure the morphology of spots on the surfaces of UCDs via light curve inversion. We will also search for flare events and correlate those flare events to specific spots structures.  Surface activity in UCDs is related to stellar wind and ultraviolet emission from their chromospheres, both of which affect the photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets. Understanding the nature of surface activity on UCDs is therefore critical for interpreting transit-transmission spectroscopy, as well as inferring the habitability of any detected planets. K2 provides a unique opportunity to study ultra-cool dwarfs in a way never before realized."
GO14013,14,Teo,,Mocnik,Keele University,t.mocnik@keele.ac.uk,"Southworth, John; Hellier, Coel","Short-cadence observations of WASP-104, K2-38 and K2-34","We propose to observe three planetary systems in the short-cadence observing mode: WASP-104 (Smith et al. 2014, Campaign 14), K2-38 (Sinukoff et al. 2016, Campaign 15) and K2-34 (Hirano et al. 2016, Lillo-Box et al. 2016, Campaign 16).

WASP-104 hosts a transiting hot Jupiter with a short orbital period of 1.8d. According to the current system parameters and assuming the optical geometric albedo of 0.1, this short-period planet should produce reflectional phase-curve modulation with a semi-amplitude of ~27ppm. For a bright (V=11.1) and photometrically quiet host star, such reflectional modulation should be detectable using K2 photometry. Although the previous ground based photometric observations placed a 4mmag upper limit on rotational modulation, the stellar G8 spectral type suggests that some starspots could still be present. If so, the short-cadence observations may reveal starspot occultation events, a valuable detection for determining precise stellar rotational period and obliquity.

K2-38 has been observed by the K2 during the observing Campaign 2 in the long-cadence observing mode, which resulted in the discovery of a transiting hot super-Earth and a hot sub-Neptune. This compact planetary configuration is an ideal candidate to search for transit-timing variations. The 1-min short-cadence is essential as it provides a much improved precision of individual transits' timing measurements compared to long-cadence.

K2-34 is transited by a slightly inflated hot Jupiter, which was discovered using the K2 long-cadence photometry from the observing Campaign 5. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain why some of the planets are inflated, and expanding the sample of inflated planets with accurate parameters is of particular interest. The K2 Campaign 5 lightcurve has indicated a possible rotational modulation with a period of 19d. Additional photometric dataset would put this detection to the test. Since rotational modulations are caused by the presence of starspots, the short-cadence K2 lightcurve may exhibit any potential starspot occultation events.

In addition to science goals mentioned above, the research of all three planetary systems would benefit from the short-cadence K2 observations in several aspects: refinement of system parameters with improved precision, search for transit-timing variations, additional transiting planets, phase-curve modulation, starspot occultations and rotational modulation.

Our team has developed a data reduction procedure to correct the drift artefacts from the K2 short-cadence lightcurves to restore the near-original Kepler-like photometric precision (Mocnik et al. 2016). We also have experience with K2 short-cadence data analysis."
GO14014,14,Aleks,,Scholz,University of St Andrews,as110@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Peterson, Dawn E; Matt, Sean P; Stelzer, Beate; Damasso, Mario","Rotation of M dwarfs: spindown, activity, and gyrochronology","Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter for the evolution of stars and planets. Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy.  Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012). For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission.  The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars.  Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem.  Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013).  Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. Several hundred of them (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields from 2014 to 2017. We have successfully applied for time in previous campaigns and the lightcurves for campaigns 0-5 are fully analysed and the paper is published  (Stelzer et al., A&A, 2016). The analysis for campaigns 6-9 is underway, observations for campaign 11-13 are approved. For fields 14-16, we propose to include again about 100 targets in the K2 fields for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them will fall onto the Kepler chips. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner using the procedures developed for previous campaigns."

Occasionally, however, K2 re-observes portions of the sky that it has already surveyed, so it is possible to use existing K2 data to plan future observations. We propose Cycle 5 K2 observations of targets observed in previous K2 campaigns, with a particular focus on stars hosting transiting planet candidates. During Cycle 5, portions of Fields 2 and 5 will be reobserved (during Campaigns 15 and 16, respectively). We have produced light curves of stars that could be re-observed during Cycle 5 and searched both by eye and by an automated pipeline to identify planet candidates and interesting variables. We propose short-cadence observations of some of the more interesting planet candidates which would benefit most from improved sampling.

Observing targets across multiple campaigns brings a number of benefits. Chiefly, it allows improved constraints on the timing of periodic signals like transiting planets. Additionally, knowing about planet candidates before K2 observations makes short cadence observations of interesting candidates possible, which can significantly improve transit parameters and can reveal transit-timing variations.  Lastly, the longer duration of observations allows for study the evolution of phenomena (like stellar magnetic activity) that vary on timescales longer than a single campaign.

Module 2 of Field 15 overlaps nearly entirely with Module 23 of Field 2, and almost 30% of Field 5 overlaps with Field 16. We have reduced light curves from these overlapping regions following Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) and searched for transiting planets using the methodology of Vanderburg et al. (2016). In addition, we visually inspected each overlapping light curve by eye to find planet candidates missed by our automated search (including planet candidates with single or few transits), and also to find other interesting or noteworthy variable stars such as young dipper stars (e.g. Ansdell et al. 2016).  We propose short-cadence observations of several systems. One of these systems is K2-38 (Sinukoff et al. 2016), a two-planet system around a bright solar-type star, which already has an RV mass measurement. Short cadence observations will improve the measurement of the planet radius, giving better constraints on the planets bulk composition. Other systems for which we propose short cadence observations include several planetary systems in Praesepe (Mann et al. 2016). Short cadence observations of these stars will improve transit parameters and could yield spin/orbit alignment information from starspot crossing events."

Additionally, we propose long-cadence observations of hundreds of known and candidate white dwarfs, many of which are known to be magnetic, in close binaries, or harbor remnant planetary systems.

Overall, our program will more than quadruple the number of rotation rates measured for white dwarfs, putting strong constraints on the evolution of angular momentum in the final stages of stellar evolution. We will also characterize the orbital periods of many new post-common-envelope binaries (close WD+dM), informing Type Ia supernova population synthesis models. The proposed observations will provide the capstone for our legacy dataset of white dwarf variability with K2, which will revolutionize our understanding of stellar remnants for the next decade."

Like gas giant planets, very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs form condensate clouds in their atmospheres. For the nearest ultracool dwarfs, K2 can uniquely characterize variability due to these clouds, both rotation modulation on a timescale of hours and weather evolution of the clouds on timescales from days to months. Magnetic activity changes dramatically at the stellar/substellar hydrogen-burning limits. We have already demonstrated that ultracool dwarfs can generate white light flares and superflares in our previous Kepler and K2 campaigns, but increasing the sample size is important to constraint the rate of these rare events as a function of effective temperature and age. Flares are tied to magnetic reconnection rates and the energy budget. We also aim to detect transiting exoplanets by continuing to monitor each available ultracool dwarf in K2 campaigns; brown dwarfs, gas giants, and even large rocky planets are detectable. The K2 targets include nearby field late-M and L dwarfs, and even faint targets are valuable, since transits may be total and flares can be 20-40 times the photosphere in the Kepler filter. Campaign 15 includes the key target 2MASSW J1507476-162738, a bright L5 dwarf at 7.2 pc."
GO14019,14,Elme,,Breedt,University of Warwick,E.Breedt@warwick.ac.uk,,Accretion disc variability in Cataclysmic Variables,"Accretion discs are a common occurrence in the universe. They exist on physical scales spanning orders of magnitude, ranging from the parsec scale discs which power active galactic nuclei to protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (few thousand km). The flow of material and angular momentum through these discs are governed by the same underlying physical processes, but timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion discs around cataclysmic variables (CVs) are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure and the effects of accretion rate variations, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Continuing our programme from campaigns 0 to 13, we propose to monitor the CVs and X-ray binaries in the K2 fields with the aim of building a library of high quality light curves that can be used to investigate disc-based phenomena. CVs and other accreting compact objects display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days). The unique capability of Kepler/K2 to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is key to understand accretion and accretion variability over such a wide range of timescales.

We will request 40 targets in Cycle 5, in a mix of long and short cadence mode."

For instance, the only rocky exoplanets for which mass estimates have been made (except for the few fortuitous systems that exhibit transit-timing variations) are those in ultra-short period orbits  Kepler-10 b and Kepler-78 b are two famous examples. Moreover, understanding the origins of ultra-short period planets may elucidate key processes in formation and evolution. Gas disk migration may have brought the objects in from where they formed but would require disks extending to nearly the stellar surfaces, contrary to observations and theoretical expectations that stellar magnetospheres truncate gas disks much farther out. On the other hand, if such planets were scattered in by dynamical interactions with other planets in the system, then we would expect to find additional planets around most stars with ultra-short-period planets, making those systems good targets for follow-up radial velocity searches. Furthermore, ultra-short-period planets that are the cores of evaporated hot Jupiters are likely much denser than planets similar to Earth that were scattered in, offering a way to test the frequency of each theoretical formation method -- if the targets are bright enough for us to collect high-precision radial velocity data to measure the mass.

We propose to collect photometric observations of stars that may host ultra-short period planets (with periods < 1 day) using the K2 mission. We will convert the raw K2 images into light curves and search for transits. We will follow up putative transit candidates with spectral, radial velocity, and high-spatial resolution observations to continue the already fruitful and exciting search for ultra-short period planets. All candidates and their suitability for followup will be regularly published and updated online for the general community.

Targets  Our targets are bright main-sequence G-M stars, select specifically so they will be most suitable for radial velocity (RV) mass measurements. All targets have been checked to fall on K2 silicon (code 2). We request that our targets be observed even if this proposal is not selected for funding.

Methodology  For Task 1, we will generate photometric time series from the raw K2 images, and the Kepler PyKE python package provides the necessary capabilities, based on Vanderburg & Johnson (2014). For Task 2, we will detrend light curves and apply an automated search algorithm (EEBLS  Kovacs et al., 2002) to find transits, as we have with previous campaigns (Adams et al. 2016). We will also perform photometric and pixel-level analyses to vet candidate signals. For Task 3, for vetted candidates, we will characterize host stars and collect RV observations using low-precision spectra to rule out binaries and blend scenarios. For available targets, we will collect and analyze precise RVs from the HRS spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory to confirm candidates as planets and estimate their masses. For targets inaccessible from McDonald, we will propose for follow-up observations at another suitable facility (e.g. Keck). We will also conduct high-spatial resolution observations using the Robo-AO system to rule out possible blend scenarios masquerading as planets and to get accurate stellar and planetary parameters.

Relevance  This proposal will use the unique capabilities of the K2 mission to look for an unusual and astrophysically compelling class of planet.

We will discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  Our K2 samples will also be useful for planet occurrence measurements to detect variations in the prevalence of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood.  This Cycle 5 request for Campaigns 14, 15, 16 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in Campaigns 0-13 (PIs Howard, Sanchis-Ojeda, Petigura, and Winn) that constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.  We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts.  Here we request magnitude-limited samples of Fields 14-16 comprising approximately 10,000 stars each in long-cadence mode.  We will continue our search for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013).  We catalog the planets discovered, their orbital and physical properties, and their host star characteristics, as in the recent catalog by our team (Crossfield et al. 2016) that found 197 planet candidates and 104 validated planets in K2 Campaigns 0-4.

We will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES, the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory, and other facilities.  We were awarded a NASA-Keck Key Project specifically to measure K2 planet masses using 40 nights on Keck-HIRES. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultra-short-period Earths.

(2015) discovered the first transit signal around a white dwarf (WD 1145+017) using data from the Kepler mission. WD 1145 demonstrated for the first time a direct link between white dwarfs having metal lines and an infrared-excess with solid bodies orbiting the star. The evolution of planetary systems is a fundamentally important question in astrophysics, however our understanding of their end states, in an observational sense, is all but unconstrained. Thus far, most searches for planets around white dwarfs have focused on identifying planets in the habitable zone of white dwarfs. WD 1145 was an unanticipated discovery and has resulted in a wide literature attempting to characterize the transits and theoretically understand the source of the material in orbit. Theory can only be constrained so much by a single system. There is a great deal to be learned from turning WD 1145 from a single example into a class of objects.
 
Previous studies of white dwarf transits have focused on detecting planets around these stars. The goal of this study is to look at systems for which we know there is material orbiting in debris disks. Using a combination of the Montreal White Dwarf Database (Dufour et al. 2016) and the WISE InfraRed Excesses around Degenerates (WIRED) Survey (Debes et al 2011, 2013) we have identified 86 unique white dwarfs with IR excesses. Of the 86 stars, only 2 lie on active silicon during campaigns 14-16, all in C14. Constraints on debris disk geometry suggest orbital periods from hours to days  and transit durations of 2-4 minutes (Algol 2011, Vanderburg 2015). Observationally we find that transit depths vary from 10-50%. The short transit duration, multiplicity of periods, and variation in transit timing (Gary et al. 2016) expected in these systems means that transit signals can be easily washed out if observed with 30 minute cadence, so short 2 minute cadence is required to detect and resolve these transits."

Much of exoplanet science hinges on a thorough understanding of the planets host star. As a result of the push toward lower mass and more widely separated exoplanets, it has become increasingly important to properly characterize exoplanet hosts and efficiently distinguish the signals from planets from signals from the star itself. Currently, stellar physical processes on the surfaces of stars poses a major deterrent to our ability to detect exoplanets. In radial velocity (RV) measurements, these processes induce noise, coined jitter, that can imitate or drown out the signals of planets. As new transiting planets are discovered by K2 and TESS, it will be imperative to have new methods of prioritizing ground-based RV follow-up, especially given that Kepler alone provided more planet candidates than can be followed-up in a reasonable time-frame with all ground-based resources combined. By accurately predicting the level of stellar jitter of a host star, we can readily identify the most promising targets for both the RV follow-up of transiting planet candidates and the RV discovery of new exoplanets. 
	We propose to use the high-precision light curves from the K2 mission with archival RV jitter and activity measurements to (1) develop an empirical relation between RV jitter and light curve variations, following the methodology developed by Bastien et al. (2014) and (2) determine the dependency of the relation on age, spectral type, and magnetic activity. These relations will prove useful for RV follow-up of existing transiting exoplanet candidates. We will use them to identify targets that have low levels of RV jitter and use them to uncover the physical causes of RV jitter, which will help optimize the use of upcoming RV facilities like NASAs NEID spectrograph.  2.	Description of Methodology to be Used
Bastien et al. (2014) showed that short-timescale light curve variations, called flicker are strongly correlated with RV jitter for magnetically inactive stars. Current work involves extending this relation from the 12 California Planet Survey (CPS) stars in the Kepler field to stars in the K2 campaigns. Due to the multiple fields of the K2 mission, there is larger overlap between CPS stars and potential K2 targets. Past and future K2 campaigns (0-11) have increased the initial CPS-Kepler sample by nearly 50 stars. Here we have identified roughly 30 stars across Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 of the K2 mission with existing RV time series from CPS, which will provide further refinement of this empirical relation. More importantly, they will allow coverage over a wider range of spectral types, ages, and activity levels. Thus, we will be able to fully explore the photometric manifestations of RV jitter and develop the tools necessary for improved RV target selection in a timeframe suitable for the upcoming space missions and ground-based instruments, such as the TESS mission or the NEID spectrograph."
GO14027,14,Ann,E.,Wehrle,Space Science Institute,awehrle@spacescience.org,"Carini, Michael Thomas; Wiita, Paul J",Optical Variability of Blazars and Quasars,"We propose to measure the  long cadence light curves  of  eleven Fermi gamma-ray blazars: six in Campaign 14 and  five in Campaign 16, including one (3C 207)  which we observed in Campaign 5. We have data from 20 Fermi gamma-ray blazars in hand or being processed and observations of 3 more are scheduled.  Our ongoing K2 observations have already detected significant optical variability in ~ 83% of gamma-ray blazars, including binary black hole candidate OJ 287, ~ 16 of radio loud quasars, and ~ 5 of radio quiet quasars.   Our  scientific goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in the blazars at the time of K2 observations. Three candidate origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk with one or more thermal emitting regions. We will also determine if the origin of emission from the re-observable  blazar 3C 207 has changed since 2015. We will compare the optical variability amplitude and power spectral densities   of the gamma-ray blazars to those of less extreme blazars, and to those of their parent class of radio loud quasars, and to those of the much larger class of radio quiet quasars -- on hours-to-months timescales.  Data from the latter classes are in hand or scheduled for observations. We will measure the power spectral densities of the light curves and determine the power spectral densities' slopes which are related to the underlying variability processes, such as turbulence in the relativistic jets or stochastic fluctuations in thermal emission from segments of the accretion disk.  Relevance: The proposed research is relevant to the K2 Cycle 5 solicitation because we will carry out an investigation of science targets using the high precision photometry of the K2 mission with the goal of understanding the origin of optical emission in the cores of active galactic nuclei. We address the NASA Astrophysics goal of understanding the nature of black holes in the Universe."

A major result from surveys for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars.  This trend is not seen, however, around super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al 2015).  We propose to search a large sample of sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] < 0.0) stars in the fields of K2 GO Cycle 5 Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 for transiting planets of all sizes.  Stars in this metallicity range fall into three populations: a) the thin-disk (which also extends into super-solar metallicity), b) the thick-disk, and c) the halo (which extends to extremely metal poor stars). These three populations differ both kinematically and chemically.  Thick disk stars exhibit a larger vertical scale height in the galactic orbits, and they also show alpha-capture element abundances enhanced by about a factor of two over thin-disk stars.  Halo stars show even more extreme kinematics and also exhibit significant enhancement of alpha-capture elements.  K2 field 14, being located at high galactic latitude, will be especially important for its larger fraction of thick disk and halo stars than are found in fields at lower galactic latitude. The discovery of the Kepler-444 system (Campante et al 2015), which comprises five sub-Earth size planets orbiting an ancient (11.2 Gy age) thick-disk star with significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe=H]=-0.69 +/- 0.09 dex) shows that planet formation started very early in the history of the galaxy.  We will obtain the data necessary to compute planet occurrence rates for stars as a function of stellar metallicity, stellar population and of planet radius.  For stellar metallicity, we will consider not just the standard [Fe/H] abundance, but also the abundance of the very important alpha-capture elements.  The goal of our program is to determine the characteristics of the first stars in our Galaxy to form potentially habitable planetary systems.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W.  Cochran) and the European KESPRINT consortium (represented in this proposal by Dr. M. Fridlund) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.

Targets:
We will propose a large sample of 2952 targets.  They range in V magnitude from about 6.4 to 12.4, with a median magnitude of 10.3.  Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2015, MNRAS, 247, 2880) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 80 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems. These results will provide important new constraints on the physics and chemistry of planetary system formation, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes and photometry, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? In order to answer this question, we need to understand their multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates.   The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above. Because of the limited precision on the ground based observations to measure rotation periods, we propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates as one of the key approaches to solve the width problem. In K2 fields 14, 15 and 16, we will observe 22 nearby systems, including two K dwarfs and 20 M dwarfs. One of the systems is GJ406, which is the closest dwarf at only 2.6pc among all K2 campaigns. By combing stars previously observed by K2, we have a total of 74 stars within 25 pc in K2 campaigns. We expect to have the most complete characterization of a set of the nearest K and M stars in all K2 campaigns that have ever been accomplished."

Stellar clusters provide a homogeneous sample of stars in which the major independent variable is the stellar mass. The different ages of the clusters will help us to understand the early dynamical evolution of planetary systems. We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team. The PICK2 project has already collected K2 data on the Hyades, Pleiades, Praesepe and Ruprecht 147 clusters. In K2 campaign 16 we will be able to observe different - and previously unexplored - parts of the M67 and Praesepe open clusters.

We will search the K2 light curves for planetary transit signatures. We will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, and high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates. We will perform detailed spectral analysis in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Our team has just discovered a transiting super-giant planet or brown dwarf in the Ruprecht 147 cluster (Nowak et al. 2016) and has confirmed several new K2 planets (Johnson et al. 2016; Barragan et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2016) o) Perceived significance:

GO14032,14,Michele,,Montgomery,University of Central Florida,montgomery@physics.ucf.edu,"Voloshina, Irina; Olenick, Richard P",Evolutionary Paths of AM CVn's to Supernovae,"Of the most probable paths to supernova type I, three involve AM CVn systems, which are close binary systems where the primary member is a white dwarf. The secondary could be another white dwarf (i.e., a double-degenerate channel), the core of an evolved, once hydrogen-rich main sequence star [i.e., a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) channel], or a semi-degenerate helium star (i.e., a helium star channel). The probabilities to the three paths and identification of a particular path for a known AM CVn system are not well known. Recently we have identified several parameters that are predicted to identify the paths and even go further as to eliminate a path for a particular AM CVn system. Necessary for study of these parameters are observations of light curves, and in particular quiescence to and through Stage A of a superoutburst that is nearly always missed from ground-based observations. As such, we have a limited sample to confirm our predictions using ground-based data. Necessary are the observations we propose for K2 Cycle 5, Campaigns 14-16 for both AM CVn systems and CV systems. We need to observe CV systems so we can differentiate between the evolutionary path of a normal CV (i.e., white dwarf primary and main sequence or evolved secondary) and the CV channel for AM CVn systems. For all observations, we will simultaneously observe from the ground in the R band using the Sternberg Astronomical Observatory and in the V band using the University of Dallas at Texas observatories. We have put together a national and international team of experts to achieve these goals. This project will involve undergraduate student observers using ground-based telescopes."
GO14033,14,Bernard,Scott,Gaudi,The Ohio State University,gaudi@astronomy.ohio-state.edu,"Paetzold, Martin; Cochran, William D.; Shporer, Avi; Csizmadia, Szilard; Johnson, Marshall C; Eigmueller, Philipp; Grziwa, Sascha",Probing the Planetary Population of High-Mass Stars (K2-GO5),"Objectives: To date most planet searches have been confined to stars of spectral type F and later, as hotter stars have fewer spectral lines and tend to be rapidly rotating, making precise radial velocity (RV) observations difficult. By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can help to expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiants and giants in this mass range [1], but the masses of these stars have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus ~60 planet candidates that are awaiting validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement (sub)giant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets, and close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the (sub)giants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars. There are currently only ~20 such confirmed planets; this population is currently almost totally unexplored. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2.

Targets: We request 301 long cadence targets, ~1/2 of which will be in Field 16. This will build on the ~1500 targets we have been granted earlier in the K2 mission. The sample consists of A and early F-type dwarfs with 8<V<13, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: We will extract lightcurves of our targets from the K2 pixel data, correct these for systematics, and search for transit signals. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m telescope at McDonald Observatory and the forthcoming NRES spectrographs for the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network, and high-resolution imaging with Robo-AO and the Large Binocular Telescope. For long-period targets with only 2 or 3 transits in the K2 data, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with LCO and the DEMONEXT robotic 0.5m telescope. Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other methods. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (where we spectroscopically resolve the stellar line profile perturbation during the transit due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit [5]. We will use the statistical techniques developed to validate Kepler planets for any candidates not amenable to phase curve detection or Doppler tomography.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

Two complementary approaches have been adopted, the first centered on in-depth studies of the Sun itself, and the second focusing on the study of solar analogs, stars which are like the Sun and thus might shed light on characteristics of its composition, structure, activity, planetary system, evolution, and future. The utility of the study of solar analogs is broad, ranging from finding night-time proxies for the Sun for calibration purposes to their use as snapshots of the evolutionary history of the Sun. Their study has helped to establish that chromospheric activity is key to understanding stellar rotation, activity, and dynamos. The project proposed here is aimed at providing a large consistent set of well-vetted solar analogs in order to address these questions. We will make use of the K2 mission fields to obtain precise photometric time series of approximately 1000 solar analogs, supplemented by asteroseismology and ground- and space-based spectroscopic data for the brighter and more promising candidates. From this data we will derive rotation periods, spot coverages, and flare rates for a well-calibrated sample of solar analogs. This work expands and extends our ongoing Kepler and K2 analysis, and supports an ongoing project under NASA's Living With a Star program; the use of new fields will also allow us to compare different stellar populations and provide a growing sample of test data for the study of stellar activity, rotation, and dynamos.

The chosen targets will be selected on the basis of existing ground-based photometry supplemented by spectroscopy when available and guided by previous results and population models using TRILEGAL. We anticipate that <10% of the stars in our sample will be giants, but we can make use of light curves and power spectra to eliminate giants from our sample after the fact based on granulation noise (Mathur et al. 2011, Bastien et al. 2013, 2015). We will reduce our limiting magnitude from the ~14 we used for Kepler to ~12.5 to roughly compensate for the increased noise in K2 compared to Kepler, and make ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up easier."

E.",Dynamical Activity in Algol-Type Interacting Binaries,"We propose K2 photometry of 18 binaries with Algol-type light curves in Campaign (C) Fields 14-16 to study gas stream impact and spot dynamics that influence the evolution of these systems. Most early-type stars begin as binary or multiple star systems, so an understanding the evolution of the Algol systems is critical for a more general knowledge of massive star and galactic evolution. All but one observation will be in the long cadence mode. In C16 we will have the opportunity to revisit three interesting binaries that were observed in K2 C5 and look for long-term variability. One system, S Cnc, for which we propose short cadence coverage is a well studied late-term Algol that displays a total eclipse. We plan to apply for observing time at KPNO to obtain spectra that will support the K2 observations, especially those in C16. The K2 mission and the modeling capabilities of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary system analysis program present a unique opportunity to probe gas stream dynamics and/or magnetic activity from the recently discovered quadrature brightness variations in Algol binaries that we call L/T variables. L/T is the flux ratio between the quadrature flux at phase 0.25 to that at phase 0.75 (Leading and Trailing hemispheres on the primary star). The L/T phenomenon was discovered in Kepler data and has never been reported in ground-based photometry. L/T behavior is likely due to changes in either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the impact site's location and movement can be diagnostic of stream dynamics that may be modulated by magnetic fields. In the cool spot scenario the variability is a consequence of magnetic activity on the mass loser. New data from K2 Cycle 5 will improve our statistical study of the percentage of Algols that show L/T inequality and indicate whether there is a preference for L > T or the reverse.   Modeling the K2 light curves with the WD program, stellar and spot parameters, including spot motions, will be determined so as to generate an image of the binary versus time.  Updates to the WD program will be made available to the community."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is known about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. In addition, the detection of eclipsing stellar companions is of high interest for stellar astrophysics, because it allows one to directly measure the mass and radius of a star, which in turn calibrates the fundamental ""mass-radius relationship"", which is a critical test of stellar structure and evolution models. We expect our proposed program to discover several of these important mass-radius calibrators, which would for the first time obtain mass and radius measurements for old, low-mass stars with low metal abundances. Our ongoing program has now identified three likely eclipsing binaries in K2 campaigns 4-7, out of 6,376 halo stars monitored. The small numbers shows how rare these systems are in the halo population, and emphasizes the need for monitoring larger samples of halo stars. Campaigns 14-15-16 are very favorable to this, with campaign 14 close to the North Galactic cap. Our astrometric and photometric analysis of these three fields identifies 3,959 high-velocity subdwarfs, which are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, in order to attempt once more to identify and characterize the first generations of exoplanets in our Galaxy, and to identify additional eclipsing systems to be used as mass-radius calibrators. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits using an auto-correlation and Fourier analysis method developed by our team. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based follow-up observations, to confirm the existence of the transits/eclipses. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."
GO14040,14,Michael,Thomas,Carini,Western Kentucky University,mike.carini@wku.edu,,Rapid Optical Variability in Infrared and Optically Bright blazars,"Blazars are extreme examples of the phenomena known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak or completely absent discrete spectral features leaves us with only continuum variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F14, 15 and 16 fields of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of less than 100 objects with Kep magnitude < 18 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip that are not previously identified blazars. The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density on timescales from minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to lengthen the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies."
GO14041,14,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,Rotation rates for stars in wide binary systems and a search for hierarchical triples in Kepler K2 campaigns 14-15-16.,"Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and presumably have very similar chemical compositions. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated, which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are. Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 14, 15, and 16, we have identified a total of 194 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 60. Our statistical analysis indicates that >90% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignments of unrelated stars). About half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. A majority of the  secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, many pairs can be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target (or may use fewer pixels overall). One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, which means that a significant fraction of wide binaries may actually be hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or eclipsing) binary star; this prediction will be directly tested with K2, by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries in those pairs."
GO14044,14,Patrick,,Gaulme,New Mexico State University,gaulme@nmsu.edu,"Jackiewicz, Jason; Guzik, Joyce Ann; Harrison, Thomas Edward",Stellar Pulsations in Eclipsing-Binary Systems,"Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. As illustrated by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, asteroseismology of solar-like stars is an efficient method to measure masses, radii, and ages of large numbers of stars, which is of prime importance to test stellar evolution. However, a crucial test of both asteroseismic masses and radii of a large sample of stars with independent measurements of those quantities has not yet been carried out. Eclipsing binary systems (EBs) potentially permit such an exercise by allowing for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, provided that spectral lines are detectable for both components (e.g., Gaulme et al. 2016).  EBs are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough. As an example, Gaulme et al. 2014 noticed that among red giants belonging to EBs about a third do not display oscillations. They showed the shorter the orbital period and the closer the stars are, the weaker the oscillation modes become, until complete mode depletion is reached. This is observed in the closest systems where rotational and orbital periods are almost synchronized and where strong surface activity is detected. Beyond solar-like oscillators, the Kepler mission led to a much clearer understanding of the oscillation spectra of classical pulsators as RR-Lyrae, gamma-Doradus or delta-Scuti stars (e.g., Keen et al. 2015, Ouazzani et al. 2015, Kurtz et al. 2016). As patterns in the mode distributions are becoming clearer and inference on these stars improve, a similar need for ``benchmarks'' become important. Observing stars that likely pulsate and belong to eclipsing binaries are precious targets for studying stellar evolution in the common multiple evolution configuration.  In the field of views of campaign 14, 15, and 16, we have identified a set of binary systems with components that are likely on the instability strip, displaying oscillations from Beta Ceph to Delta Scuti, and maybe even solar-like oscillations. We will propose this set to be observed in the main proposal. Long cadence will be enough for most of the systems.  No funding will be requested.

Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approx. 25% at circa 1 Gyr, Zuckerman et al.2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.  The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically significant (1000 to 1500) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a significant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).  A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al.(2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al.(2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD? This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery.

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm(5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 177, 17 and 242 WDs (campaigns 14, 15 and 16), that have been spectroscopically identified or are deemed to have a 60% or greater probability of being a WD (Fusillo et al. 2015), and which are brighter than Kepler Magnitude 19.5 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues."

Some of the most notable studies have revealed i) the mass ratio and precise orbital parameters through Doppler beaming and Romer delays for compact binaries (Bloemen et al. 2011, MNRAS,410, 178), ii) stringent tests to the disk instability model through the precise characterization of dwarf nova (DN) outburst cycles and (Cannizzo et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 117), iii) a plethora of currently unexplained periodicities in the AM CVn system SDSS J190817.07+394036.4 (Kupfer et al. 2015, MNRAS, 453, 483), iv) the discovery of the rms-flux relation in the aperiodic flickering of accreting white dwarfs (WD, Scaringi et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 2854), v) the discovery of a universal scaling relation linking the timing properties of Active Galactic Nuclei, accreting stellar-mass black holes, accreting white dwarfs and young-stellar objects (Scaringi et al. 2015, Sci.

Most targets have been selected from the Ritter & Kolb catalogue (A&A, 404, 301). The exact target list will be defined on submission of the Step 2 proposal. For all targets in our sample we will probe their broad-band variability properties.

Blue Supergiant (BSG) stars are the progenitors of core collapse supernovae. They are descendants of early O- and B-type stars, and provide a natural link between the main sequence evolution and the advanced evolutionary phases of the most massive stars. BSGs can influence the chemistry of their host galaxy by ejecting their metal-rich envelopes
into the interstellar medium. Moreover, they seed the formation of neutron stars or black holes, which are the sources of gravitational waves which we have just begun to detect. Thus, it is of utmost importance to study single and binary blue supergiants, due to their broad astrophysical applications.
Because massive stars are scarce and evolve on short timescales, even a single object is extremely valuable to the astrophysical community.

BSGs exhibit photometric and spectroscopic variabilities due to radial/nonradial oscillations (e.g. Kaufer et al. 1996, 1997; Lefever et al. 2009, Moravveji et al. 2012a). We employ asteroseismology (in-depth analysis and modeling of pulsating stars) to address  fundamental questions regarding massive stars.  rho Leonidis is a single B1 Iab star, and is a confirmed pulsating BSG. We have been monitoring the spectroscopic variability of this target since June 2010 using high-resolution spectrographs attached to the Mercator-1.2m, NOT-2.6m and SONG-1m telescopes. We use the SiIII4567 diagnostic line, which is sensitive to the local temperature and gravity fluctuations at the surface of early-type stars. Based on that, rho Leo exhibits a rich pulsation pattern with short-period modes of a few hours as well as long-period modes of a few days. The observed variability is in agreement with the theoretical predictions of heat-driven modes excited by the kappa-mechanism (Saio 2011, MNRAS; Godart et al. 2016, A&A). The predicted oscillations are due to unstable g-modes with a broad period range. The interest of the proposed observations of rho Leo is hence well justified from both observational and theoretical points of view.

Observing Plan.
We ask for long-cadence K2 photometry of rho Leo (V=3.9 mag) during campaign 14. The K2 data will be complemented with high-SNR high-resolution spectroscopy with the Mercator, NOT and SONG telescopes for mode identification, radial velicity and H_alpha monitoring. Such a bright star would typically need a large number of pixels to observe. However, we propose to use so-called halo photometry using the unsaturated pixels in the wings of the PSF. With this method a much smaller mask may be used. A circular mask with a radius of 20 pixels requires 1245 pixels, approximately equivalent to only four 9th mag stars. This technique has had proven success for K2 photometry of bright Hyades and Pleiades stars in campaign 4 (White et al. in prep.).

Objectives.
The K2 photometry will be combined with our ongoing monitoring survey in order to conduct thorough asteroseismic modeling of rho Leo, and address the following concrete questions: 
(1) What are the nature of excited modes in this star? Are they pressure (p-) or gravity (g-) modes?
(2) Which mechanism excites these modes? The classical kappa-mechanism (Saio 2011, MNRAS) or the epsilon-mechanism (Unno et al. 1989; Moravveji et al. 2012b, ApJ)?
(3) What is the size and mass of the convective helium core?
(4) What is the size and mass of the H-burning shell?
(5) Is there any coupling between pulsations and H_alpha variability?"
GO14051,14,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transit,"To date almost nothing is known about the final (WD) configuration of planetary systems.
Although not a single bona-fide planet orbiting an isolated WD has yet been identified, it is now widely accepted that the dusty and/or gaseous disks that we see within one solar radius around many WDs are produced by the tidal disruption of asteroids (Farihi+2010, MNRAS 404, 2123). Recently, a disintegrating minor planet transiting a white dwarf has been detected (Vanderburg+2015, Nature 526, 546; Croll+2015, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06434v1.pdf). An increasing fraction of WDs (>=27%) show a metal enrichment due to the fall into the WD atmosphere of ancient planetary material (Koester+2014, A&A 566, 34), whose chemical composition is similar to that seen in different Solar-system meteorites (Gansicke+2012, MNRAS 424, 333).
Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and the AGB phases (Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). While Gaia will discover WD planets at several AUs from their host stars, those external to the period gap (Silvotti+2015, ASPC 493, 455), this proposal aims to study the inner boundary of the period gap. Substellar companions to sdB stars offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion, thermal pulses and PN ejection, Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ 761, 121), and they are the natural 1st step to study the post-RGB evolution of planetary systems and their final architecture. Star/planet interactions during the RGB may be responsible for the stellar envelope ejection leading to the formation of a single sdB star (Soker 1998, AJ 116, 1308; Han+2012, ASPC 452, 3).
Among the first planet/BD candidates around sdB stars (Silvotti+2014, ASPC 481, 13), 2 planetary systems were detected by Kepler measuring the photometric modulation due to reflection/re-emission of the star light (Charpinet+2011, Nature 480, 496; Silvotti +2014, A&A 570, 130). Given that only 7 single sdBs were observed by Kepler for enough time to detect tiny photometric variations of 20-50 ppm, we can assume that 2/7 of sdBs have Earth-size bodies in tight orbits at ~0.005 AU from the star. With a geometric transit probability of 0.2 (Rp<<RsdB, RsdB=0.001 AU), the prob. to see a transit is about 0.057, i.e. in average we need to observe ~18 sdB stars to see one transit. Similar numbers are obtained for more massive sdB companions detected through RVs (Geier+2012 ASPC 452, 153): 16% of their sample of 27 single-lined sdBs do show small RV variations compatible with massive substellar companions.
Here the geom. transit probability at 0.005 AU is ~0.28 (Rp=0.9 Rjup) so that, in average, 1 sdB out of ~22 should show transits and secondary eclipses.
The main goal of this proposal is to detect sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targetting in SC ~40 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. With typical transit durations of 15-40 min (at 6h<Porb<24h), SC is more adequate. The transit depth may vary between 25% (1 R_Jup) down to 0.2% (1 R_Earth). Thanks to the high number of transits in a ~80 days observation, K2 should be able to measure radii smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, PEPSI@LBT and ESPRESSO@VLT (both in or near commissioning) should be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.
The secondary goal of this proposal is to detect photometric variations due to reflection effects by a faint stellar companion, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting. Kepler gave already an important contribution to this field. K2 can increase by a factor 5 to 10 the statistics of well studied sdB+WD and sdB+dM systems. We point out that the secondary goal is compatible with LC data."

astrophysics, and solving this will have significant ramifications for our understanding of how other galaxies form and evolve. Success
will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution.
This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the
solar neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used
Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential
for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.
RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar
samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program
for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to
those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.
AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (on average ~5000 per campaign) to
probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to
make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys
structure and evolution from its stellar populations.
METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by
ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use
our seismic inferred stellar properties to stresstest state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."

Rotationally induced radial velocity noise can masquerade as a low mass exoplanet. K2 photometry of these targets will uncover the rotational periods and levels of activity, directly enabling more correct interpretation of the RV signals and the discovery of exoplanets. HPF starts its science observations in 2017, and of particular interest is the forward facing Campaign 16, where the power of the HET queue-scheduled observations enables HPF to acquire spectra and RVs on a number of bright M dwarfs simultaneously with K2 photometry, enabling techniques like FF' and Gaussian Processes to be brought to bear on the continuous photometry+RV data set. The goal of this project is directly in line with NASA and community goals of detection of low mass exoplanets in or near Habitable Zones of our nearest neighbors, and with Decadal Recommendations of using precision RVs to detect and characterize low mass planets."
GO14057,14,Nanda,,Rea,Instituto de Ciencias del Espacio (CSIC-IEEC),rea@ice.csic.es,"Maccarone, Thomas Joseph; Scaringi, Simone; Knigge, Christian; Coti Zelati, Francesco; Torres, Diego F.; Israel, GianLuca; Campana, Sergio; Serenelli, Aldo; Papitto, Alessandro; D'Avanzo, Paolo",K2 short-cadence observations of the prototypical transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038,"The short spin periods of binary millisecond pulsars are the outcome of the accretion onto the neutron star (NS) of the mass transferred by a low mass late type companion star, through an accretion disc (Alpar et al. 1982, Nature, 300, 728). After a Gyr-long mass accretion phase during which the binary system shines as a bright low mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB), the mass transfer rate declines and allows the activation of a, now rapidly spinning, radio/gamma-ray millisecond pulsar (MSP) powered by the rotation of its magnetic field. The tight link existing between radio MSP and NS-LMXB has been recently demonstrated by the discovery of three transitional millisecond pulsars (PSR J1023+0038, Archibald et al. 2009 Science, 324, 1411; IGR J18245-2452 in the globular cluster M28, Papitto et al. 2013 Nature 501, 517; XSS J12270-4859, de Martino et al. 2010 A&A 515, A25, Bassa et al. 2014MNRAS, 441, 1825). These sources have been observed to switch between accretion and rotation-powered emission on timescales possibly shorter than a couple of weeks, showing that such state transitions may take place on time scales compatible with those of the variations of the mass accretion rate onto the NS.  At high mass inflow rates, the radio pulsar is shut-off and the system is bright in the X-rays (LX > 10^36 erg/s). At low mass inflow rates, the magnetosphere expands up to the light cylinder activating the radio pulsar, the disc disappears and the system is faint in the X-rays (LX~10^32 erg/s). Surprisingly, in addition to the X-ray outbursts accreting state and the radio pulsar state, the three known transitional MSPs have been observed into another extremely peculiar subluminous disc state with LX~10^33 erg/s. During these states both PSR J1023+0038 (Archibald et al. 2014) and XSS J1227-4859 (Papitto et al. 2015) showed that part of the disc material is accreted onto the NS surface. These subluminous states are accompained by a sizable gamma-ray flux and a flat-radio spectrum that are typical jets signatures in accreting compact objects, suggesting that large mass outflows could be launched by the fast rotating propellering magnetosphere of these pulsars (Papitto et al. 2014 MNRAS 438, 2105; Papitto & Torres 2015, ApJ 807, 33). Observing these sources is of crucial importance to understand how accretion and ejection are coupled and the role of the magnetic fields in driving outflows and jets. Currently the timescales of the transitions are only loosly constrained to about a few months, and strong fast variability is also observed on seconds/minutes timescales in several bands. Studying the multi-band fast variability of these transitional objects is extremely important because they reflect the timescales of disc formation, or the transition into a jet-dominated outflow or of the disc evaporation, or on a faster timescales the disk/magnetospheric interaction. A transition between the radio pulsar and the subluminous disc state (or even full surface accretion state) is accompanied by a marked variation of the optical emission. In the radio pulsar state the irradiated donor star dominates the optical output. The flux typically attains a magnitude ranging between V~17-19 mag with large amplitude variations along the orbital period (e.g. Bogdanov et al. 2014; de Martino et al. 2014 MNRAS 444, 3004). During the subluminous or accretion disc state the disc dominates the optical emission producing a brightening by 1-2 magnitudes, often with an irregular fast variability from X-rays to optical/nIR (de Martino et al. 2013, A&A 550 A89; de Martino et al. 2014). The prototype of the transitional ms-pulsars, PSR J1023+0038 will be visible by Kepler 2 in Cycle 5 during Campaign 14. K2 observations in short cadence of this source will represent a unique set of data to study the fast optical variability of this object. Our group has already asked for multi-band observations XMM/Swift/Nustar/VLT to partially overlap with the K2 observations."
GO14058,14,Robert,,Szabo,Konkoly Observatory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences,rszabo@konkoly.hu,"Smolec, Radoslaw; Kolenberg, Katrien; Molnar, Laszlo; Plachy, Emese",The K2 RR Lyrae and Cepheid survey,"Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars play a crucial role in astrophysics as standard candles, tracers of galactic history, and touchstones for modeling stellar pulsations. Space data of these objects have led to a giant leap forward in our understanding of their structure and evolution through the discovery of new dynamical phenomena. Moreover, insight into these stars dynamics is of utmost importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. Throughout the K2 Mission we have been building a unique database of high precision RR Lyrae light curves from field to field, covering different parts of our Galaxy, and beyond. In this proposal we plan to study ~650 RR Lyrae stars in Fields 14-15-16. Our strategy assures that galactic structure studies and statistical analysis of pulsation properties (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko modulation, period doubling, low-dimensional chaos, non-radial modes) based on K2 data will be possible. Besides the ensemble studies, the analysis of individual stars will be equally interesting and important. For example, low-amplitude additional modes have been observed in all RR Lyrae subtypes, but their origins and occurrence rates are still largely unknown. We plan to complete our K2 Cepheid sample with a few Type II Cepheids in Field 15.  Targets. Approximately 650 RR Lyrae stars will be proposed (3-4 stars per field for short cadence observations) in the three fields, and 5 Type II Cepheids in Field 15. Field 14, towards the North Galactic Cap, contains 147 RR Lyrae stars, 11 RRd and 30 RRc stars among them. Field 15 has close to 400 RR Lyrae (5 RRd and 36 RRc) and 5 Type II Cepheids (2 BL Her, 2 W Vir and 1 RV Tau type). Finally, Field 16 offers 105 RR Lyrae targets (3 RRd, 22 RRc). Fields 14 & 16 do not have good Cepheid candidates. We will benefit from the overlap with previous fields (C5/C16 has 23, while C2/C15 has 2 common RR Lyrae targets); luckily both overlaps contain priority short-cadence RRc stars. Re-observation of these targets present a unique opportunity to assess our earlier findings that were based on previous K2 observations, and allows us to look at any longer term changes to our targets, such as Blazhko modulation, and the stability of additional modes.
 
Methods and community resources. Photometry of large-amplitude pulsators requires special treatment, and general-purpose pipelines may provide RR Lyrae light curves with sub-optimal quality. Therefore, we developed a specific algorithm (Extended Aperture Photometry, EAP) to deal with these difficulties. As a value-added community resource we publish a searchable database containing the light curves, frequency solutions and other parameters (Blazhko periods, additional modes, etc.) of the RR Lyrae and Cepheid stars observed by K2. Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. Metallicities will be derived from empirical relations calibrated with high-resolution spectra. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations.

Experience of team members. Our team consists of members of the Working Group#7 (RR Lyrae and Cepheids) of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, who have been working on Kepler data (also preparation and target selection) since the launch of the original mission. Our scientists are experts on data reduction, pixel photometry, light curve and time-frequency analysis, as well as theorists performing numerical hydrodynamical modeling. We routinely analyze Kepler and K2 data, and published 20 Kepler/K2 RR Lyrae and Cepheid papers in high-impact journals. The group has access to ground-based follow-up (multi-color photometric and spectroscopic) instruments in Taiwan, Korea, USA, Canada and Hungary."
GO14059,14,Anna,,Marciniak,Adam Mickiewicz University,am@amu.edu.pl,"Szabo, Robert; Szakats, Robert; Kiss, Csaba; Mueller, Thomas G",Physical studies of asteroids with Kepler,"As it has been demonstrated in some recent papers, the Kepler Space Telescope in the K2 mission is an excellent tool to observe asteroids and obtain accurate lightcurves even if the targets are relatively fast-moving main belt asteroids (Szabo et al., 2015, 2016a) or Jovian Trojans (Szabo et al., 2016b).   While in the case of trans-Neptunian bodies the lightcurve information is available for a limited sample only (see e.g. Kiss et al., 2015), the general spin characteristics of main belt asteroids are relatively well know due to their proximity and relatively short (~few years) orbital periods that allows us to observe these bodies at various spin axis aspect angles during their motion around the Sun. The sufficient orbital phase coverage also allows us to apply lightcurve inversion techniques to obtain detailed shape models for these targets (Kaasalainen et al., 2002).  In this proposal our goal is to obtain lightcurves of slowly rotating asteroids with low amplitudes, to decrease the strong selection effects in spin and shape studies of asteroids. Currently spin and shape models are mainly available for targets with relatively short rotation periods and substantial elongations of their shapes that results in a biased sample of asteroids with known physical properties (Marciniak et al. 2015). Consequently, our knowledge on spin vs. diameter, the internal cohesion and strength or the non-gravitational effects are biased, too. Data from asteroids observed in the K2 mission can substantially increase the data pool for asteroids omitted in previous studies, enabling continuous observations of targets with periods of the order of days.  We also investigate small asteroids with spin axes close to the ecliptic plane. Some studies suggest their non-existence due to non-gravitational YORP effect (Durech et al. 2016). However, such lack can be a selection effect, because such targets often display very small amplitudes when viewed pole-on. Kepler/K2 data will allow us to decide whether the low amplitude of these targets are due to close to pole-on configurations.   We propose to observe a set of main belt asteroids for which additional high-quality lightcurve data obtained with K2 would enable us to obtain spin and shape models for the first time. Some of the targets, (203) Pompeja, (566) Stereoskopia and (308) Polyxo have rotation periods close to 12h or 24h and have small, <0.1 mag lightcurve amplitudes. These targets are difficult to observe from ground due to daily gaps and aliases, and would require coordinated observations from many observing sites, typically flawed by weather conditions. The Kepler Space Telescope is able to perform these observations alone. (525) Adelaide is a target with highly inclined spin axis and strongly variable amplitudes, sometimes being as low as 0.02 mag. Obtaining full, composite lightcurve of this P=19.967 h target would be very difficult from the ground, as the period exceeds the length of the average observing night. In practice, only continuous data from a space-based observatory can provide meaningful data for this target. (437) Rhodia is a very slow rotator with a period of ~56 hours, and variable, usually very low amplitudes. A sufficiently long, continuous measurement of this target would allow us to determine the orientation of its (likely) multiple spin axes.   All our 14 targets will spend enough time on silicon (typically ~5 days) that a sufficient light curve coverage can be guaranteed.  References: - Durech et al., 2016, A&A, 587, A48

Indeed, K2 observed the first such example in Campaign 1: WD1145+017 (Vanderburg et al. 2015), which we have followed-up on with high resolution spectroscopy (Redfield et al. 2016). Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013). The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations. The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]). Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015). I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns).

Methodology: Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total. The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits. The first planets detected were around a compact object, a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992). Additionally, N-body simulations of planetary systems through stellar evolution indicate it is possible to return significant mass objects back very close to the white dwarf (Veras & Gaensicke 2015), so it is likely for white dwarfs to host planets. Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign. Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence. Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground. While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation. However, a followup campaign on known targets is quite straightforward. At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope. However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO14063,14,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",Monitoring of Targets Within 100 Parsecs,"Science Goals and Objectives: Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 parsecs provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres. A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets. It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come. I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 pc. A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons. This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes. This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques. Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars. While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges. A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be 200-300 stars (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars). In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored. The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets.

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability. An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003). One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium. This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint. Long cadence observations would be appropriate.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found. These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."

These parts (the bulge, thick disk, thin disk, halo) feature distinct stellar populations, and understanding the properties of those populations is an ongoing effort. Studying these properties relies on reliable fundamental parameters of stars: their masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities. Eclipsing binary stars lend themselves naturally to this task, since their favorable geometrical orientation and basic laws of gravity enable us to determine fundamental parameters to a ~1% accuracy. We scoured the published catalogs and proprietary KELT and SuperWASP data for all eclipsing binary stars in K2 C14, C15 and C16 fields. We propose to observe these stars and, along with other serendipitous discoveries of binarity in the fields, build a stellar population model based on the fundamental parameters derived from K2 data and follow-up multi-color photometry and spectroscopy. Studying the intrinsic differences in stellar populations across K2 fields will allow us to infer the dependence on galactic latitude and contribute to our understanding of stellar population distribution in our Galaxy."

Kepler monitored 15 of these systems. The detailed coverage enabled unique studies of quiescent orbital and sporadic variability as well as the changes in the disk and stream impact area during short and long dwarf nova outbursts. We propose to monitor a set of CVs in the K2 fields of Campaigns 14, 15 and 16. The Cycle 5 fields represent the extremes of stellar densities with the directions toward the pole and Galactic center. We have matched the K2 fields with several CV databases and selected a total of about 33 targets for this cycle. These data will extend the range of CV types studied with Kepler's unprecedented continuous, fast-candence observations.

For Campaign 16 observed in the forward facing direction, simultaneous ground-based observations are possible. We plan extensive photometric monitoring of the brighter CVs observed with K2 in complementary filters and fast cadences."
GO14067,14,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,brice.demory@csh.unibe.ch,,Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types from M0 to L8, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such exoplanet has been discovered for the first time earlier this year. As of today, K2 represents an unprecedented opportunity to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0 through 13 observations.  SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.  High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).  RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.  METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 14, 15 and 16, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series (Demory et al. 2016). The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on existing K2 data and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program.  EXPECTED YIELD. We have assembled a list of 139 M6 to L3 objects for campaigns 13 to 16. Several targets have been observed in previous campaigns and have been removed for the target list to avoid duplication.

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."
GO14068,14,Adam,Gabriel,Jensen,University of Nebraska-Kearney,JensenAG@unk.edu,"Redfield, Seth; Cauley, Paul Wilson; Endl, Michael",Searching for (More) Extended Exoplanetary Atmospheres Around Active Stars,"A key question in studying any planetary atmosphere is what happens at the boundary between the atmosphere and interplanetary space. This unbound, outermost layer of an atmosphere is called its exosphere. Several observations of extended atmospheres have been made (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Schlawin et al. 2010; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010, 2012; Fossati et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2012; Cauley et al. 2015, 2016) in hydrogen (both ground-state and excited) and various metals.  Our team detected excited, n=2 hydrogen (through hydrogen alpha absorption) in the exosphere of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012), the first such detection in an exoplanet's atmosphere. Follow-up observations (Cauley et al. 2015, 2016) confirmed this result by detecting exospheric absorption in hydrogen alpha, hydrogen beta, and hydrogen gamma, and also observed a significant pre-transit signal in these lines. The pre-transit signal is variable between the two observation sets and the physical interpretation is not clear. Jensen et al. (2012) hypothesized that the excited hydrogen in the exosphere (the transit signal) may be correlated with chromospheric activity, as HD 189733b, the only planet in that paper's sample of four planets to show H-alpha absorption, was also the most chromospherically active in the sample (as measured by S_HK and log [R'_HK] indices).  In Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 3, we proposed to search for planets around stars which are candidates for chromospheric activity in the Kepler 8 and 10 fields. We found dozens of suitable targets based on the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Survey's catalogue of chromospherically active stars (Zerjal et al. 2013).  A similar proposal in Cycle 4 was not selected for funding but a small subset of our targets will be observed.  We now propose to do the same for Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 5 for the Kepler Campaign 14, 15, and 16 fields. Because Field 15 is in the southern celestial hemisphere, it will have the most targets provided by the RAVE survey.  Adding targets from these fields will greatly improve the chance of success of the accepted Cycle 3 proposal at minimal cost of targets to the K2 mission (data from Field 8, which had a much smaller number of targets than Field 10, again due to the location of the fields and our reliance on the RAVE database, has been downloaded and is being analyzed; data for Field 10 and Cycle 4 targets have not yet been released).

Looking for planets around active stars with radial velocity methods is often disfavored because the stellar noise limits RV precision. However, this makes the transit method the more important way to detect planets in these cases. Furthermore, if any of these stars do have a transiting planet, they will be excellent potential candidates for follow-up spectroscopy with the large ground-based telescopes (Keck I, HobbyEberly Telescope) that our team has used in the past to detect exospheric absorption. The goal of follow-up spectroscopic observations would be to search for excited hydrogen absorption from an exosphere, including possible pre-transit signals. As a secondary science product, many of these active stars will have light curves worth studying on their own for stellar astrophysics purposes."

Scientific Justification 
We request K2 monitoring of unidentified and known X-ray sources in Campaigns 14 through 16, compiled from a variety of sources
 including the Chandra Source Catalog and the Million Quasar Catalog, to probe accretion onto compact objects at a variety of mass
 and time scales. Our KSwAGS survey found 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., 2015). Approximately
 half were active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various types (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring
 M-stars). A Kepler GO survey (PI: Still) of Chandra point sources resulted in a similar distribution of stars to active galaxies. High
 precision optical follow-up is scientifically useful for all sources; the AGN allow for a study of variability characteristics as a function
 of SMBH mass (Smith et al., 2015) and the stars allow for the study of a variety of rapid rotators and chromospheric activity (Howell
 et al., 2016). We received time for K2 to monitor KSwAGS sources in Fields 4,8 and 11-13. This proposal has identical scientific
 goals and will continue the K2 optical monitoring of X-ray sources, but with target selection criteria that relies on archival X-ray
 observations only and not on new Swift pointings. 
Previous AGN in the original Kepler field were selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012).
 These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 10^8 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum
 is dominated by starlight rather than AGN light (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2012). Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-
MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be
 constrained by a ~80-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks.
 This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is
 expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or
 other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk). This further monitoring will critically
 enhance the sample numbers of K2-monitored AGN discovered using a relatively unbiased selection method. We expect on the order of
 50-100 targets in each Field depending on galactic latitude.  Methodology and Relevance to NASA Astrophysics Science Goals 
We aim to use K2s impressive photometric precision to detect characteristic variability timescales using Fourier analysis. These
 timescales are the only possible direct observables of AGN accretion physics, which remains an important astrophysical mystery and
 directly addresses NASA Astrophysics goal to ""[d]iscover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search
 for life on planets around other stars."".  Additionally, these X-ray selected targets will fill in the phase-space of black hole mass and
 accretion rate, complementing our work in the original Kepler field."

We propose a short-cadence study of key nearby mid-M dwarfs. These stars are fully convective yet generate powerful magnetic reconnection events. We will measure the white light flare rate as a function of rotation and luminosity and compare it the flare rate in hotter and cooler stars. Davenport et al. found a universal template describes nearly all Kepler white light flares in the M4 dwarf GJ1243. We, however, have found evidence that M7 and later dwarfs have systematically difference cooling rates in their light curves.  We also find complex flares and interpret them in terms of EIT waves and conditions in the coronae. By studying active flare stars between M4 and M7 we can map these changes as a function of stellar temperature."
GO14073,14,Will,,Grundy,Lowell Observatory,W.Grundy@lowell.edu,"Ragozzine, Darin A; Thirouin, Audrey; Ryan, Erin Lee; Porter, Simon Bernard",Evolution of Spin States in Transneptunian Binaries,"We propose K2 observations of 22 transneptunian objects to constrain their spin states and learn about their formation environment in the protoplanetary nebula.  We are especially targeting binaries and potential binaries.  Their spin states preserve observable and interpretable signatures of their formation circumstances.  They are also subject to subsequent dynamical evolution, notably tidal despinning, offering opportunities to learn about those processes as well.  Disentangling these influences calls for a large sample of well-characterized systems to enable statistical comparison of ensemble properties across the various sub-populations.  This proposal contributes toward the goal of assembling that sample.  We will observe all known transneptunian binary systems on silicon during C14-C16, as well as a number of potential binaries.  K2s ability to observe continuously is key to teasing apart the rotational modulations of unresolved multi-body systems if they are different, or being able to determine that they are not, in cases where they have become tidally locked like Pluto and Charon.

We have assembled a team with all necessary expertise to fully capitalize on the data.  We have experience working with K2 data and have a proven processing pipeline.  We have a strong track record in both observational and theoretical Kuiper belt studies, including analysis of photometric lightcurve data, orbit determination, and dynamical modeling.

This project would be impractical from the ground.  The targets are faint, and weeks or even months of observing time would be needed to confidently extract the weak modulation from a fainter secondary not tidally locked to its primary.  K2 is ideally suited for this work.  Long cadence exposures provide adequate temporal resolution.

One of NASA's key strategic goals in planetary science is advancing knowledge of the origin and history of the Solar System.  This proposal is aimed squarely at that goal, specifically for the transneptunian region where our targets formed.  We aim to shed light on how the Sun's inventory of planets and minor bodies originated and subsequently evolved to its current dynamical configuration and compositional state.  Observations of the Cold Classical sub-population of transneptunian objects also provide valuable context for NASA's upcoming flyby and detailed study of one such object, 2014 MU69, along with the more distant observations of a larger sample of them that New Horizons is doing as it cruises through that region of the Kuiper belt."
GO14074,14,Niall,R,Deacon,University of Hertfordshire,nialldeacon@hotmail.com,"Mann, Andrew Withycombe; Kraus, Adam L",The effect of wide binaries on planet occurrence - K2 Cycle 5,"We plan to observe a sample of wide binaries spread across the K2 fields to constrain the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence and to provide benchmark systems for gyrochronology.

 
Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence.} Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013).  In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star. Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity.Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars.

 
 
Science Goal 2: Provide benchmark gyrochronology systems. Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components.

 
 
By including wide binary components as Kepler targets, we will produce a valuable legacy product to test and recalibrate gyrochronology relations allowing the ages of field stars to be better constrained.

 
Target Selection. We will use the proper motion catalogue produced by Kraus et al. (2014) based on the methods of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007) including proper motions, estimated spectral types and distance moduli from SED fitting. We will select objects with significant (>5sigma) proper motions above 30mas/yr. From these we will select pairs of widely separated objects with common proper motion and distance.  To remove contamination due to coincident pairings of unrelated field stars, we will plot a histogram similar to the one we constructed for field 6 of pair separation. From this we will select pairs which lie in the region dominated by true physical pairs."

Monitoring of these galaxies will allow us to look for fast (t > 10 day) and faint (M < -15) stellar transients. The K2 science mission, with its long baseline, high-cadence, good light-gathering power allows us to obtain high precision photometry. The ability to monitor several targets simultaneously provides a unique opportunity to examine such a broad range of variables and transients.  The fast transients we wish to examine are defined by their fainter than SNe (Mv < -16) magnitudes, fast rise times and/or short lifetime. Perets et al. 2010 found a new class of faint events that were spectroscopically similar to SN Ib/c but had strong calcium lines in their nebular spectra. These objects characterized by a relatively fast light curve (12 - 15 days), making them difficult to find by traditional surveys, and thus the progenitors of these interesting events are unknown  In addition, Drout et al. 2014, using the Pan-STARRS1 survey, found a few transients that were relatively bright (-16 < M < -20) but with a time near maximum of only a few days. Even though they are bright, their short time scale, some brightening in only a day, means these events are usually missed. The stellar origin of these events is also unknown. PTF has been a prolific discoverer of unique short-lived and/or faint events as well.  This program will also be sensitive to LBV- and nova-like eruptions, large amplitude flare stars, cataclysmic variable stars, and other still unknown types of faint, fast transients.  We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe these galaxies every other day using SkyMapper and ATLAS Pathfinder. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify the transients using PESSTO, and existing programs at Siding Spring, Lick, Gemini, and Keck"

We propose a Large K2 Program to monitor on the order of 10,000 bright galaxies in each of Campaign C14, C15, and C16, which should yield in total more than 15 great light curves (LCs) of supernovae. In Kepler GO programs, we have identified to date 3 SN Ia (Olling et al. 2015), 2 SN IIP (Garnavich et al. 2016; Tucker et al., submitted), and 1 SN IIn/Ia-csm (Garnavich et al., in prep.). We also found that ~4% of our galaxies display AGN activity with variability at >0.001% level (Shaya et al 2015). In K2 Campaign C3, C5, C6, C8, and C10 we identified more than 15 SNe, three of which we spectroscopically classified. Analysis of the K2 data is ongoing.  With our program, we plan to a) determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe using features in the early breakout (t < 4 days) LCs; b) explore the explosion physics of SN, especially SN Ia, using subtle features during their rise (t < 20 days); c) improve the calibration of SN Ia as standard candles for measuring distances, Ho, and dark energy using K2 LCs of unprecedented detail; and d) add significant knowledge to the virtually unexplored very low-Eddington regime of AGN.  There is an ongoing controversy over the basic physics of one of the key tools in cosmology, the SN Ia standard candle. Do SNe Ia gradually reach critical mass via accretion from a companion star or does it merge with another WD? If a white dwarf had been accreting mass from a companion star, as the ejecta reaches the companion a shock would form with observable optical emission (Kasen 2010). The emission would be short and strongest from certain viewing angles, requiring rapid cadence for several SNe before definitive conclusions can be reached. For the 3 SN Ia discovered by Kepler monitoring of ~500 galaxies (Olling et al. 2015), no signatures of a companion were found and tight constraints were placed. With a larger sample, we can determine the statistics for the two possible channels that trigger SN Ia. Meanwhile, features due to the different explosion physics (detonation, deflagration, inwards-moving diffusion waves, etc) of Ia and core collapse SNe will also be revealed. K2 will allow for the first time to test models more complicated than simple ""expanding fireballs.""  We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe the entire field every other day using SkyMapper, ATLAS and DECam. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify discovered transients using Lick, Gemini, and Keck. In Campaign C5 and C6, we successfully identified 4 SNe with DECam observations, of which we classified 2 with Gemini spectra as SN Ia. These data, coupled with high precision 30 minute K2 data will have enormous legacy value.  Methods: 
We have developed and proven a highly successful detrending method that simultaneously solves for the sawtooth pattern caused by pointing motion and for the coefficients of vectors from principal component analysis of targets on the same channel. This iterative technique permits us to define aperture sizes better suited to this problem and to make excellent corrections for sensitivity variations on all time scales. To properly correct SN light curves, the technique is applied to the quiet time before the event and then extrapolated to the end of the campaign.  References:

These cores are at the centers of all horizontal branch stars so understanding them has impact across much of astronomy. Our understanding comes from applying seismic constraints from their pulsations to stellar models which contain appropriate physics. Only Kepler (K1) and K2 observations have proven sufficient to interpret their pulsations (even TESS will not contribute). So campaigns 14 to 16 are our last chance to accumulate observational data. Pulsating horizontal branch cores are sdBV stars. K1 discovered 19 and K2 (to C8) has discovered 18 and observed 2 known sdBV stars. Through several years experience, we have made great progress, with several analyses ongoing. We have learned to robustly assign pulsation modes using asymptotic period spacings, rotationally split multiplets, and the value of the Ledoux constant. These supply extremely strong constraints to structural models, which prior to K1 were under-constrained, but now demonstrate contradictions between observation and theory. This implies that the models require new physics, especially regarding the physics of diffusion and tides, and will lead to a better understanding of stellar structure.
 We anticipated degeneracies between core mass, envelope mass, and evolution, requiring multiple stars to overcome. From K1, and continuing with K2, we have found that core masses in sdBV stars have a narrow range. We have uncovered new features including: stars with differential and others with uniform rotation; stars with stable pulsations and others with stochastic properties; frequency multiplets which we associate with stellar rotation that are constant, converging, or diverging; pulsations in only pressure (surface) modes, only gravity (core-sensing) modes, and both (hybrids); varying degrees of mode trapping, which is a consequence of  internal stratification; and rotation rates which are long, sub-synchronous when in binaries, yet we are discovering groupings, likely related to mass loss/exchange mechanisms.To discriminate the causes of these various features will require substantial modelling efforts, but those can only proceed with observational constraints. As such, we still urgently need K2 observations of sdBV stars covering the full range of pulsation properties, especially in the pressure-mode domain, which is very sparsely populated by K1+K2 observations.
 Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterisation, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have already published over 20 papers from K1 and five from K2.
 We propose to observe about 5-8 stars per campaign, most of which are so far unobserved for pulsations. We only select the most promising targets, both in terms of potential pulsation and binary properties. Processes we can probe include radiative and gravitational diffusion; binary interaction, mass and
angular momentum exchange; post-helium flash core structure; and helium fusion cross-sections via evolution.
 We also include students in our work. Many of our papers include undergraduate students as significant contributors. Students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret K2 data for pulsations and binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterisation studies, providing them with a broad range of training. Graduate students at European partner institutions will be working with us; processing and interpreting pulsations, as well as developing new physics for sdB star models as part of their thesis work. Only K2 provides sufficient accuracy, duty cycle, and duration necessary to fully exploit sdB pulsations as a probe of stellar astrophysics."

With effective temperature 6697 ± 78 K (spectroscopy), mass 1.39 solar masses (asteroseismology) and radius 1.49 solar radii (interferometry), theta Cyg was expected from pulsation models to show gamma Doradus-type g-mode pulsations with periods of order one day, but no g modes were detected.  However, theta Cyg does exhibit stochastically excited solar-like oscillations with frequency of maximum amplitude 1829 µHz that were used for asteroseismic modeling.

KIC 8462852 (a.k.a. Tabby's star) was observed by Kepler for 16 quarters, however, only in long cadence.  Spectroscopic observations place this star at effective temperature 6750 ± 120 K, with an estimated mass 1.43 solar masses and radius 1.58 solar radii (Boyajian et al. 2016, MNRAS 457, 3988).   KIC 8462852 shows a prominent small-amplitude period of 0.88 day that is probably related to rotation, as well as a longer period (10-20 day) brightness variation.  This star notably shows irregular mysterious flux decreases of up to 20 percent lasting 5 to 80 days, as well as a slow brightness decrease of about a percent throughout the Kepler mission. The causes of these unusual brightness changes are under investigation(Boyajian et al. 2016; Montet and Simon 2016, ApJL 830, L39; Wright and Sigurdssen 2016, ApJL, 829, L3).  Although external causes such as eclipses by comet swarms are a leading explanation, intrinsic stellar brightness variations by an unknown mechanism have not been entirely ruled out.  An asteroseismic analysis of KIC 87462852 cannot be carried out (yet) because of the lack of short-cadence observations that may have revealed solar-like oscillations such as those found in theta Cyg.

We expect that short-cadence K2 observations of relatively bright mid-F main-sequence stars will provide additional pulsating targets for detailed asteroseismic modeling.  Finding stars that exhibit both solar-like observations and gamma Dor g-mode or even delta Sct-like p-mode oscillations would provide constraints on stellar properties, age, and pulsation driving mechanisms.  There may exist analogs of theta Cyg or KIC 8462852 in the Kepler and K2 data archives observed in short cadence, although the Kepler targets are likely to be less bright or have shorter time-series observations than theta Cyg or KIC 8462852.  Solar-like oscillations were first characterized with a partial quarter of Kepler data for theta Cyg, and they have also been measured in short-cadence K2 data (e.g., Lund et al. 2016, MNRAS 463, 200).  The generally higher-amplitude gamma Dor and delta Sct pulsations should be detectable, if they exist.  Perhaps asteroseismic modeling of additional F3 V spectral-type stars will provide clues to the strange photometric variations of KIC 8462852, or at least help to rule out intrinsic brightness variations.  It is even possible that stars with similar anomalous brightness variations may be discovered.  Further observations of such stars would help to define and explain the transition region between solar-like and gamma Doradus pulsators on the main sequence.

Our small-proposal budget request is $20 K for the PI to execute the project.  The possibility exists to leverage support via the New Mexico Consortium for a student shared between the PI institution and New Mexico State University."

Due to their low luminosity, their habitable zones (HZ) lie very close to the star (within ~0.2 AU). They are thus prime targets in the search for habitable worlds because planets in their HZ induce deep transits and high-amplitude radial velocities compared to planets in the HZ of Sun-like stars. A long debate has ensued on whether they could be habitable. A primary complication is that M-dwarfs remain magnetically active, exhibiting a high rate of strong stellar flares, for billions of years. There are predictions that a combination of flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and energetic particles from an active M-dwarf could render a planet uninhabitable. However, these predictions rely on extrapolating observations of the Sun's radiation environment by orders of magnitude to model events on active M-dwarfs. To test whether the magnetic activity from M-dwarfs are consistent with solar correlations or if they require new relationships,we propose to observe four M-dwarf flare stars with K2 short cadence data and supplement these observations with simultaneous ground-based radio observations. Radio spectroscopy surveys offer the potential to detect CMEs and stellar energetic particles. These simultaneous observations will allow us to measure the relationship between CME kinetic energy, energetic particle flux, and optical flare energy for radio bursts that are associated with flares. Additionally, simultaneous K2 optical data can help distinguish between different radio emission mechanisms by looking for radio bursts drifting in frequency shortly after large optical flares. The study of stellar coherent radio bursts is still at an exploratory stage, but it promises to be a unique way of detecting stellar space weather events. This research has direct implications to exoplanet habitability because the first places we will search for life on an exoplanet will be a cool star.

Our primary target is Wolf 359; a star well-studied in science fact and fiction that is amongst our nearest stellar neighbors. At a distance of just 2.4 pc, this mid-M dwarf provides an ideal laboratory to research the physical processes of the coolest stars. We also propose three other targets: AZ Cnc is an M6.5 star whose flaring behavior has been well studied; DP Cnc and CS Cnc are bright early M-dwarfs that were observed by K2 in C5 and show large but unresolved flares in the long cadence data collected."

GO14084,14,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,"Stello, Dennis; Guhathakurta, Puragra; Sharma, Sanjib",The K2 Remote Halo Project: Probing the Metallicity Distribution of Red Giants,"Goals. Galactic halo stellar populations strongly constrain star formation at the earliest epochs, and the assembly and the mass of the halo. The best halo tracers are K giants, for they occur in populations of all metallicities and ages, and remain visible to 100 kpc. The main obstacle is in distinguishing remote halo giants from intervening dwarfs. Spectroscopic confirmation, for example by SEGUE and LAMOST, has tried to improve the ~3% yield of giants in sparse halo fields by targeting warm red giants of low metallicity. Consequently, the underlying halo profile and metallicity distribution cannot be directly extracted from the known giant sample (Xue et al. 2014). Our goal is to provide the true metallicity distribution of distant halo stars by reducing the metallicity bias in their selection.

We propose to distinguish dozens of remote giants solely from Kepler 2 long-cadence light curves. Unlike multi-object spectroscopy, Kepler 2 can observe a thousand halo stars at once. This C14 work adds 14 known giants and 901 faint cool red giant candidates with temperatures < 4600K, and a minimal metallicity bias, to the thousands of such targets we have already obtained in previous K2 halo campaign fields, beginning with C6. The C14 data are required to yield fifty or more giants > 35 kpc, necessary for a meaningful metallicity distribution. We will make public all derived parameters and provide a legacy of Kepler light curves for remote halo giants and thick disk dwarfs.

Our program extends to fainter magnitudes the work of the Galactic Archaeology Program on the inner Galactic halo. Due to noisier light curves, our work sacrifices asteroseismology parameters for a simple derivation of dwarf/giant status and of log g, and relies on SDSS photometry for temperature determinations. Since luminosity is metallicity-dependent in old giants, this assessment of luminosity also yields an estimate of metallicity.

Methods. Our approach in C14, as in previous halo campaigns, selects stars likely to be giants based on their ugr colors compared to those of Castelli & Kurucz (2003) model photospheres, as verified from known giants and dwarfs. We remove stars with photometry more consistent with dwarfs than giants, yielding giant targets with a much lower metallicity bias. To limit this bias and to remove M dwarfs, our targets have 0.90 < (g-r)o < 1.22. 853 have 15.0 < Kp < 18.5, too faint for APOGEE, GAIA, or GALAH. Keck/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy, covering 6450 - 9150A at 1.2A resolution (R ~ 6500), is anticipated for dozens of giants, during twilight hours in time granted to us for giants in very remote systems (e.g. Gilbert et al. 2014).

Unlike dwarfs, light curves of luminous giants have a strong p-mode and granulation signal at low frequencies (e.g. Stello et al. 2014). These can be detected to Kp ~ 18.5, for which a giant with Mr = -2 is over 100 kpc distant. We have demonstrated this by measuring p-mode peaks in the power spectra of Kepler light curves of low-metallicity APOKASC giants, breaking them into quarters and adding noise at various levels. Kallinger et al. (2016) derived log g from the time scale of granulation and p-mode oscillations combined, an approach also very well suited to these faint but luminous giants. The interloping stars are mid- to late-K dwarfs well above the Galactic plane, whose light curves can reveal close binaries and rapidly-rotating stars. A comparison of their binary and rotation frequency with that of Kepler thin disk K-dwarfs will constrain thick-disk formation.

Relevance. The original Kepler field is at low Galactic latitude, b = +13.5deg, with significant and variable reddening; halo giants are swamped by dwarfs of the thin disk. In contrast, C14 targets are at b = +53deg, as are our previous K2 targets, with low reddening and a sightline that runs past the Galactic thick disk into its halo. The K2 high-latitude fields C1 and C3 contained very few suitable faint stellar targets."

Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system, colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk, & studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength limiting models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies.  Lightcurves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations and their origins. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. These 2 populations are in resonances with Jupiter & collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations . Results from the WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojans & ~40% of Hildas are either extremely elongated objects or binaries, however preliminary results from our Kepler GO2-GO3 suggest a higher binary fraction within the Trojans and lower within the Hildas.  Ground based surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability study due to large amounts of observing time required (approximately 4 to 5 nights per object on a 2-m class telescope) & nightly aliasing effects on lightcurves. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform and the correspondence between the C14 & C16 fields and the L5 Trojan cloud.

The science objectives of this program are as follows: 
Objective 1: Measure the lightcurve amplitude for ~ 90 Hildas and Trojans for comparison with the Scattered Kuiper Belt population 
Objective 2: Determine binary fraction of Hildas and Trojans via lightcurve transits and compare to results from the Kuiper Belt & WISE  Methodology: We have identified 89 objects for study in the Hilda and Trojan asteroids to be studied with Kepler in C14-16 with magnitudes of m_V < 21. Due to the overlap between the Campaign 14 field and the L5 Trojan cloud, our request for data represents 56 objects Campaign 14 (30 Hildas, 26 Trojans), 25 objects in Campaign 15 ( 21 Hildas and 4 Trojans) & 8 L4 Trojans in Campaign 16. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 24 days. Due to the motion of these targets, the Kepler Science Center assesses solar system program as containing more targets than proposed number of objects, (In C11, our program with 70 solar system targets was assessed 17118 Kepler target masks), thus THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity to address objectives 1&2.  Relevance to K2: 
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 14-16 to determine if these objects originated in the Kuiper Belt and later migrated and are amenable to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission and defined observing fields."

This outgassing however presents challenges to characterizing comet nuclei in terms of surface color and rotational period which are utilized to characterize their asteroid siblings. At periods wherein comets appear the brightest, their flux is dominated by gas and dust in the coma, leaving the best observational circumstances for cometary nuclei when these objects are at distances > ~3 AU beyond which sublimation of water ice does not drive the cometary coma.  Lightcurves have been utilized to estimate the limits bulk density and approximate shapes and/or axial ratios of cometary nuclei for only a small handful of the known comet population.  In many cases rotational periods of comets are poorly constrained due to incomplete ground based telescopic data over the fitted period. This results in both errors in estimates of the axial ratios and the rotational periods for the observed comet nuclei.  We propose to utilize K2 to obtain lightcurves for 11 comets in GO-5 to :
* Determine the rotational periods and amplitudes for a sample of comets at heliocentric distances > 3 AU which will be compared to other bodies such as Trojan and Hilda asteroids, as well as Kuiper Belt Objects
* Compare lightcurve periods to those published in the literature for a subsample of short period comets to determine if the rotational period of these cometary nuclei has been altered by outgassing activity Methodology:
We have identified 11 comets to be studied by Kepler in Campaigns 14-16 with magnitudes of m_V < 21. The single observation photometric uncertainty for objects of 21st magnitude observed with the 30 minute cadence of K2 is 0.15 magnitudes, sufficient to identify objects with axis ratios >= 1.15. Two comets within our sample have published rotational periods and have undergone an additional perihelion passage, allowing us to determine if the rotational period has been modified.

Relevance to K2: 
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 14-16 to determine if these objects have lightcurve periods and amplitudes common to specific asteroid populations consistent with a common origin in the early solar system. Our sample is only comprised of objects within the K2 fields, and thus does not require any modifications from the reported operational characteristics of the spacecraft during these campaigns."
GO14088,14,Gordon,T,Richards,Drexel University,gtr@physics.drexel.edu,"Kasliwal, Vishal Pramod; Vogeley, Michael S.",Quasar Variability as a Function of Accretion Rate,"Active Galactic Nuclei are known to exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Variability in the optical is observed at the 10% level in 99% of quasars. The cause of quasar variability is not known, but current theories suggest that the variations may be attributable to a combination of small-scale variations in the accretion disk viscosity that are triggered by localized dynamo processes, accretion disk instabilities, large scale fueling-rate variations, and complex oscillations of the accretion disk. Optical variability may be driven by X-ray variability which itself may be generated by flares in the accretion disk. Physical mechanisms for variability introduce causal correlation into the light curves of quasars i.e. it may be possible to probe the physical drivers of quasar variability by studying the correlation structure of their light curves.

One of the challenges in understanding the physics of quasar variability is that, while one can compute an average quasar spectral energy distribution, there is no ""standard"" quasar. The diversity of quasars is seen in their radio and X-ray continuum and UV emission lines and can be characterized by the mass-weighted accretion rate or Eddington ratio (L/LEdd). Exploring quasar variability as a function of that diversity is the focus of this work.

We will explore the amplitude/timescale of short-time variability as determined by Kepler---as a function of those quasar properties that exhibit the largest dispersion (and thus represent quasar extrema). The goal being to try to understand if quasars at opposite extremes have different short time variability that is manifested in the Kepler data and can constrain quasar physics. There are nearly 20,000 known quasars in the Campaign 14, 15, and 16 fields for which such an investigation can be conducted.  We propose to observe 2128 of the brightest targets.

We will further compare the amplitude/timescale of short-time variability as determined by Kepler to the long-time variability as determined by SDSS (and the combination of SDSS and Kepler). Here we will compare the variability to the expected variability from a Damped Random Walk (which is the same at both short and long timescale) and to a CARMA model (which can be different at short and long timescales). Again, the goal is to constrain quasar accretion physics.

Bright objects (i<~19.25, which amounts to about 12% of the samples) can be studied individually. Fainter objects can contribute to this work through stacking analysis.  Specifically, we will group the quasars by like UV (also radio and X-ray) properties and treat the light curves from them as the light curve from a single mean source.

Without a better understanding of differences in quasar variability across the diversity of quasar emission line properties, we will not be able to fully understand the physics of quasar variability. The combination of known SDSS quasars with new K2 data makes for an incredibly powerful tool for AGN variability analysis."

Many sdBs are known to have close companions with periods ranging from 0.05 to 10 days, and must have evolved through the common-envelope-ejection (CEE) process. The closest systems are quite easy to study from the ground, but Kepler observations have opened the door for precise studies of the population of systems with periods between 0.5 and and 10 days.  Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission. The excellent Kepler light curves show photometric signals from Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal deformations and mutual irradiation effects. Long-cadence K2 observations presents us with an unique opportunity to accumulate a larger sample of post-common envelope sdB binaries that can shed light on the statistics of the CEE process, and thereby constrain the long sought after efficiency parameters that govern the common envelope stage of evolution. In the process we hope to find new particularly interesting binary systems, such as the eclipsing cases and those with extraordinary masses that could be progenitors of type-Ia supernovae."

We propose to exploit the remarkable photometric accuracy and continuous evenly spaced K2 one-minute light curves to improve our physical insights on the rare transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs). Evolutionary models indicate MSPs are the descendents of neutron star Low Mass X-ray Binaries (NS-LMXBs) where the neutron star is spun-up ""recycled"" via accretion to rotation periods on the order of milliseconds. An even more direct evolutionary connection is realized in tMSPs, binary systems found to undergo transitions between a radio millisecond pulsar (RMSP) state and an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) state. Such state changes could be driven by the transition between magnetospheric accretion and emission in a shock produced from the collision of the pulsar wind and the material of the main-sequence donor star, but the increase of GeV photons in the accreting state as well as the state transition timescale on the order of weeks is perplexing. To investigate accretion in the AMXP state and a possible state transition, we request Campaign 14 K2 observations simultaneous with Swift, Fermi and SOAR of the prototypical transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) PSR J1023+0038, currently the only tMSP found in an accretion-powered regime.  Using the discrete cross-correlation function (DCF), we will cross-correlate the K2 optical data with X-ray data from proposed Swift ToO UVOT and XRT observations. To investigate emission and absorption lines in the intermittent accretion disk, we will additionally request time on the 4.1 m SOAR telescope. Our use of K2's short cadence mode will investigate the accretion in transitional millisecond pulsars in the accreting state, a key problem addressed in the Physics of the Cosmos.

Methodology & Relevance
We request short cadence mode to investigate variability on orbital and sub-orbital timescales using traditional Fourier analysis techniques as well as the zero-crossing method, which makes use of K2's continuous evenly spaced light curves.  To probe emission from the accretion disk, heating up the main-sequence star, we will cross-correlate the K2 optical data with X-ray data from proposed Swift ToO UVOT and XRT observations.  In the unlikely case that no Swift ToO's can be obtained, we search for orbital and sub-orbital variability with K2 only.  To investigate emission and absorption lines in the intermittent accretion disk, we will additionally request time on the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope.  Our use of K2's short cadence mode will investigate the accretion in transitional millisecond pulsars in the accreting state, a key problem addressed in the Physics of the Cosmos."
GO14096,14,Cole,,Johnston,KU Leuven,colecampbell.johnston@kuleuven.be,"Aerts, Conny Clara",SAMPLINg: Searching for low AMPlitude puLsatIoNs in hot sud-dwarf OB stars,"The existence of hot, compact, core helium burning sub-dwarf O and B (sdOB) objects is currently thought to be explained through different channels of binary evolution, which results in the stripping of the hydrogen envelope of an evolving star near the onset of core helium burning. The resulting population of sdOB stars consists of apparently single (merger) and both close (Common Envelope) and wide (stable Roche Lobe Over Flow) binary systems. Currently, the formation of those close binary systems is explained through competing, and poorly constrained, physical descriptions of the common-envelope phase of evolution. As they are directly the result of common-envelope evolution, the properties of close binary sdOB stars are highly sensitive to the mechanics of this phase of evolution. Additionally, sdOB stars are observed to exhibit both pressure (p-) and gravity (g-) mode pulsations, making them ideal targets for detailed seismic modeling, which enables precise and independent determination of the stellar parameters sensitive to the physics of their formation. 
Unfortunately, these objects are both rare and relatively faint. As a result, only a handful had been observed with the nominal Kepler mission, which had a stationary observing field. Furthermore, only a select few of those have had their rich pulsation spectrum exploited for seismic modeling. Most regrettably, Kepler did not observe any of the hottest sdOB pulsators exhibiting p-modes. Their interior structure could therefore not be tuned from space asteroseismology and compared with the one of the cooler g-mode sdB pulsators. Here, we plan to remedy this situation. We propose 19 objects for observation with K2 to search for pulsations for follow-up ground based observations with the MAIA multicolor photometer.
The high precision, quasi-uninterrupted observations provided only by K2 are essential for our science goals aimed at the detailed study of low amplitude compact pulsators such as sdOB stars. Moreover, the high quality data allows for the accurate detection and characterization of pulsations down to the milli-magnitude level, as well as the accurate subtraction of any binary signal present in the lightcurve. Finally, while the nominal Kepler mission saw success with sdOB stars, these observations will serve as a proof of concept for the highly anticipated TESS mission, which is restricted to shorter observing campaigns as is the K2 mission. 
The team present at the host institute of the PI has the experience and means to effectively and efficiently exploit the data provided by the K2 mission. Using these K2 data, we aim to search for pulsations in the proposed targets, and if detected use them to investigate the interior structure of these targets with detailed seismic modeling. The methodology we will employ hinges upon what type of signal is present. If binarity is detectable in the lightcurve, the methodology will consist of an iterative binary modeling and frequency analysis routine to as completely as possible model the binarity without the influence of any other signal, while simultaneously attempting to detect pulsations. If no binary signal is present in the lightcurve, we will proceed directly to the frequency analysis to search for pulsations. If pulsations are detected but cannot be identified with the K2 data, ground-based, multicolor observations will be obtained with MAIA, owned by the host institute, for mode identification of the dominant mode(s) and subsequent detailed seismic modeling synergistically using the MESA stellar modeling code and GYRE pulsation code.
	For two objects that fall within the theoretical p-mode instability strips, we request short-cadence observations as it is required to sample the high frequencies (+400 d-1) where pulsations are observed. Long-cadence observations are requested for the characterization of the remaining objects as potential binaries or g-mode pulsators to improve statistics on these objects."

These families include main belt asteroids (Szabo, R. et al., 2016), Trojans of Jupiter (Szabo, Gy. et al.), trans-Neptunian objects (Pal et al. 2015, 2016, AJ) as well as irregular satellites of giant planets (Kiss et al. 2016, Pal et al. 2016, DPS). The value and information extracted from these light curves can be incorporated as it is own in order to determine the rotation period and derive shape characteristics as well as these measurements can be combined with other types of data, mainly with the quantification of the thermal infrared emission (Muller et al. 2009). Beyond the determination these basic physical properties, we can have hints about the presence of a moon (Marton, Kiss & Muller, 2016), we can constrain the history and relation of natural satellites and trans-Neptunian objects (Pal et al. 2016, DPS) or can ask whether there is any object which spins faster than Haumea (Rabinowitz et al., 2006).

Throughout the campaigns of 14, 15 and 16, 10+25+16 trans-Neptunian objects and Centaurs fall on silicon. One of these, 2001 YH140 has already been observed by K2 (during Campaign 5). We note that more than the half of these objects (8+13+8, in total) are recent discoveries by Pan-STARRS.

Here we propose to observe 5+11+9 trans-Neptunian objects and a Quasi-Hilda comet candidate throughout K2 campaigns of 14, 15 and 16. From this set, two objects have thermal emission data. Similarly to our former proposals, we set up the target priorities according to the apparent brightness, the diversity of dynamical classes and the presence of far-infrared thermal measurements. This sample of ours include many recent Pan-STARRS discoveries for which further astrometric measurements are also valuable. Due to the large number of this total sample of relevant objects (including TNOs and Centaurs), we propose only the objects which are sufficiently bright (brighter than 22.5) and have a sufficiently long arch (i.e. longer than 30 days) on a single CCD output. However, we note that even fainter ones and objects which shorter arcs can well be measured using K2 long cadence data (see e.g. Pal et al. 2015).

Classical Be stars are rapid rotators of spectral type B and luminosity class V-III which have an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk. The disk often exhibits Balmer emission lines and an infrared excess fed by discrete mass loss events called outbursts. In spite of their high V sin i, rapid rotation alone cannot explain  the ejection episodes as most Be stars do not rotate at their critical rotation rates. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations have been analyzed to demonstrate short-term variations are rather common among early-type Be stars. The observed line profile variability (LPV) is characterized by moving bumps traveling from blue to red across the line profile on timescales ranging from minutes to a few days. Non-radial pulsations (NRP) have been proposed as an explanation of the LPV observed in hot stars. NRP produce LPV thanks to the combination of the Doppler displacement of stellar surface elements with their associated temperature variations due to the compression/expansion caused by the passage of waves through the photosphere. NRP could be the additional mechanism required for a rapidly rotating B star to become a Be star, that is to trigger the Be phenomenon by means of mass ejection(Rivinius et al. 1998).   Huat et al. (2009) found for the Be HD 49330 from CoRoT and ground-based spectroscopic data an increase in amplitude for g-modes and a decrease for p-modes just before an outburst. Neiner et al. (2012) discovered gravito-inertial modes in the Be star HD 51452. They found that the mode amplitudes were linked to the presence of mini outbursts. In general, hot Be stars display nonradial pressure pulsation modes, whereas cooler ones display gravity modes. Despite those empirical evidences, the physical processes responsible for the outbursts and mass loss in Be stars are still poorly understood. Dziembowski et al. (2007) showed that high-order g-modes driven by the kappa mechanism are unstable in the region of the HR diagram occupied by Be stars. The predicted radial velocity amplitude due to an l=3 g-mode is ~ 20 km/s for a star with 4 solar masses, with pulsation periods in the range ~0.5 - 1.1 days. For more massive and hotter stars like HD 171219, unstable modes are found with periods of 0.5-2 days.  Pulsation analysis of a star requires the measurement of frequencies with both high photometric precision and high time-frequency resolution. Only space missions provide both conditions. Since NRP in Be stars have periods near 1.0 cycles per day, Kepler observations are especially important to avoid the frequency aliases due to the day/night cycle of ground observations. Another advantage of Kepler data is the continuous observations for months with a 30 min cadence that improves the chances to observe outburst events in our targets. Stellar seismology made a great leap forward thanks to the MOST, CoRoT and Kepler satellites. We chose targets in the K2 cycle 5 fields from those already discovered as well as new targets identified by ground photometry and spectroscopy made in the present year. Our targets have Kp between 7 and 14. Long cadence (30 min) is desirable for this research. We aim to have both Kepler photometric time-series and simultaneous ground spectroscopic observations (when possible) to measure Be periodicities and understand the Be phenomenon. Our proposal fits the Small category, with 20 targets in total. Our group have experience with asteroseismology and have already worked in the same analysis with CoRoT and K2 data (cycles 3 and 4).

Be stars, as easy-to-observe objects giving a privileged peek into the structure of rapidly rotating stars, are therefore among the best suited laboratories to investigate important problems in contemporary astrophysics, like the effects of rapid rotation on stellar evolution."

They are characterized by a non-thermal, highly-polarized continuum emission spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum and  by very fast variability which has been observed down to time scales of minutes in the TeV energy range. 
We propose to exploit the unprecedented photometric precision and temporal coverage of K2 observations to investigate the correlation between optical and gamma-ray light curves in blazars. For this purpose, we have selected a sample of gamma-ray detected and gamma-ray candidate blazars that fall on the K2 silicon footprint during the upcoming observation cycle. These correlation studies can provide further insights into the mechanism responsible for the blazar emission and test the dependence of optical variability on blazar type."

These systems will allow us to improve calibrations of the age-rotation-activity relationship for field stars across a wide range in age. Flare rates and rotation periods will be measured using previously developed toolkits, and this sample will add to the ongoing analysis of Kepler and K2 wide binary systems.

Stars lose angular momentum as they age, causing their rotation periods to decline at a predictable rate. This ""gyrochronology"" method provides us with a means to determine stellar ages to within ~10% for Sun-like stars (Barnes 2010 ApJ 722 222). Wide binary systems help to extend the usable mass and age range for gyrochronology, and will be able to test new models of weakened magnetic braking in old field stars (e.g. van Saders et al. 2016 Nature, 529, 181).  A subset of the proposed sample contains white dwarf components whose cooling ages provide a benchmark against which their main sequence companions rotation ages may be compared.

Because slower rotation weakens the internal magnetic dynamo, flare rates are predicted to decline over time. As a result, older stars like the Sun exhibit very few ""super flares"". The detailed evolution of flare rates for main sequence stars of spectral types G, K, and M is poorly constrained, however, due to the small number of flare stars with known ages. Any wide binary component with a measurable flare rate and rotation age is extremely valuable for such calibrations. These systems will also become important benchmarks for other facets of magnetic activity, such as tracking the evolution of activity cycles and starspot filling factors."

So far, stars brighter than Kp < 8 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 observations of the brightest stars in campaigns 14-16, including a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels. Asteroseismic studies of these targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations which will pave the way for the success of the K2 Galactic Archeology Program, and insights into poorly understood internal processes of intermediate-mass stars such as convective core overshooting.

We will select all targets with Kp < 8 mag from the Hipparcos catalog. We will use conventional apertures and small (~24 pixel diameter) circular apertures around the saturated core for very bright (Kp < 6) targets. For the latter, we will perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method (so-called halo photometry) has been demonstrated to detect pulsations for all bright Pleiades and Hyades stars observed in Campaign 4. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Our proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics, a key science goal of the K2 mission. Our project furthermore supports galactic astrophysics, another key science area identified in the NRA, through the calibration of scaling relations for galactic archeology studies. A better understanding of stellar models through the study of bright stars is relevant for science goals pursued by both present and future NASA missions such as the characterization of exoplanets (TESS, JWST) as well as stellar populations and galaxy formation/evolution (HST, JWST)."

Due to their diversity in fundamental properties (e.g. stellar masses), low-luminosity red-giant branch (LLRGB) stars are ideal targets to tackle two key unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of host star mass and evolutionary state, and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets. Our K2 program has already discovered the first potentially re-inflated Jupiter around an oscillating evolved star (Grunblatt et al. 2016), and preliminary results indicate an sharp transition in planet occurrence as a function of stellar evolution state. Here we propose to continue our survey in C14-C16 to detect additional planets needed to confirm these intriguing results.

We selected targets using Hipparcos and Gaia parallaxes, as well as spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, RAVE and LAMOST. The availability of Gaia parallaxes and the extensive coverage by LAMOST and RAVE will yield a significantly higher yield of bona-fide LLRGBs than in previous campaigns, making C14-C16 a particularly valuable sample to achieve our science goals. Planet candidates will be detected with K2 long-cadence data using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since LLRGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up high-precision radial velocity observations using Keck/HIRES and APF will be used to confirm the planets.

The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing LLRGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise, long-cadence photometry and to discover a new population 
of rocky and potentially habitable planets and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit
spectroscopy. We propose to observe several thousand additional M dwarfs in the K2 campaigns
1416 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M
Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate 100200 small planets around late-type stars from
the full K2-MDP program. This new population of planets will drastically increase the number
of known M dwarf planetary systems, improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet
formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current
and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected on the basis of high proper-motion, photometric colors, and
supplemented with GAIA data where feasible. Our approach captures the majority of M dwarfs
within 100pc of the Sun with little contamination. Our targets have median brightness Kp<15,
most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC. We prioritize our targets using expected transit
S/N, determined by comparing K2s precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting
super-Earth. We estimate transit depths by converting multiband to spectral type and then to R
and T ef f . Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel
data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts provide stellar
parameters. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization,
aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date.

The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward all our goals. Our collaboration
has resulted in nine papers published to date, with ten currently submitted or in preparation. Our
largest results are a full C04 candidate and validated planet catalog (Crossfield et al. 2016), papers
describing M dwarf stellar characterization and candidates (Martinez et al., submitted; Dressing et
al., submitted & in prep.). We have been awarded large, multisemester programs at ESO (for spec-
troscopic follow-up), Keck (for Radial Velocity masses), and Gemini (for AO and speckle imaging).

The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims to reveal
hundreds of small planets around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-
like planets and planets suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science
drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky
planets and key transit spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO)
leading up to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; well before the launch of TESS. We also
re-propose all candidates and validated planets identified by our team in C5 (Petigura et al. in prep;
Livingston et al. in prep), in order to more fully validate the remaining candidates and to measure
TTVs and more precise system parameters for the validated planets.

The PI, Ian Crossfield, will use the bulk of any funding to support a graduate student. The
funded Co-PIs will also receive smaller allocations to support travel for observing."

The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars need to be rotating slower than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 210 days.  The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that many, but by no means all, Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars.  Currently there are only three A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-57b). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars.  Using Kepler and K2, we have a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to: 
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binarity within the Am stars, 
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars.  Only 11 Am stars were observed during the Kepler mission. So far a further 100 have so far been observed with K2. For this proposal we have around 20 targets for Campaigns 14 to 16. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to in excess of 120.  The proposal team are experienced in the reduction of Kepler data using PyKE tools and in the analysis of time-varying photometry. We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary.  The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."
GO15007,15,Daniel,L,Holdsworth,University of Central Lancashire,daniel.l.holdsworth@gmail.com,"Kurtz, Donald Wayne; Cunha, Margarida Salvador",K2 observations of the roAp star 33 Lib,"We propose Short Cadence observations of 33 Lib (HD 137949, EPIC 249835410), a known rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star. 33 Lib was among one of the first roAp stars discovered by Kurtz (1982), and was shown to have a period of 8.3 min with an amplitude of 1.45 millimagnitudes (mmag).

Since its discovery as a roAp star, 33 Lib has been the subject of photometric and spectroscopic variability studies. After the initial discovery, two lower amplitude pulsations were discovered, leading to the suggestion that 33 Lib is an ideal target to apply asteroseismic techniques to study the star. Kurtz (1991) postulated that the frequency separation between two photometric modes could be representative of the large frequency separation, but the ground-based data were insufficiently precise to make a firm conclusion. With the availability of K2 SC data we will improve on the precision previously attained and investigate the frequency separations.  SC observations are necessary to analyse this high frequency pulsator as the signature is much greater than the nominal Nyquist frequency of the Long Cadence mode. Although it is possible to study roAp stars in the super-nyquist regime (Holdsworth et al. 2014), amplitude suppression is likely to push the modes below the noise limit of the K2 data. Therefore, SC observations are key to exploiting the full potential of 33 Lib.

The pulsations in the roAp stars are thought to be driven by the kappa-mechanism acting in the hydrogen ionisation zone. However, this mechanism cannot explain all of the observations. Rather, Cunha et al. (2013) suggest that turbulent pressure might be the driving force for some roAp stars. 33 Lib is one of these stars. The observed pulsation frequencies are from modes that are predicted to be stable in models with only kappa-mechanism driving, thus the need for a full and precise frequency solution of this star is key in understanding this, and other, roAp stars.

To achieve our goals, we will conduct thorough data reduction of the provided data, aiming to maximise the output to best fit our science goals. Pulsational analysis will make use of linear and non-linear least squares fitting to the extracted lightcurve. The data will be sub-divided to monitor frequency and amplitude variations over the observing period, and the star will be compared to the other five roAp stars studied at such a high time resolution and photometric precision.  Modelling of the star will allow us to solve the mystery of the high-frequency pulsations. In particular, we will investigate the linear stability of high radial order modes in models of 33 Lib with and without envelope convection suppressed and helium settling. We will also verify whether the turbulent pressure mechanism contributes to (and eventually dominates) the excitation of the modes."

We also plan to obtain full ~60 day simultaneous multicolor monitoring with other telescopes to measure interband lags and perform accretion disk reverberation mapping.

We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2, conducting reconnaissance spectroscopy, and ultimately gathering high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models.  This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small, and the properties of the systems to date don't adequately sample the desired range of planetary and stellar properties.  We propose a ranked list of 14,287 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We will generate this list by first searching for all moderately bright stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 14, 15, and 16, and then using the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. We also propose two targets, found to have planets in previous K2 campaigns, for short cadence observations.

We will identify planet candidates using the planet detection pipeline developed by our team members. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities.  The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 80 nights per year of guaranteed time per year. The follow-up of small planets from Kepler and K2 is the top scientific priority of HARPS-N.  We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. Our team has already delivered such products for previous K2 campaigns; in particular, our 446 K2 reconnaissance spectra are the only spectroscopic observations listed on ExoFOP-K2 as of 6 Dec 2016.

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a significant impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."

This will be achieved using short-cadence (SC) data collected during K2 Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 (C14-16). This proposal follows similar ones submitted for K2 campaigns 0-13 (PIs Chaplin, Campante, Davies, and Lund).

The information contained in solar-like oscillations allows the internal stellar structure to be constrained to unprecedented levels and allows precise determinations of fundamental stellar properties (mass, radius, age). We seek to exploit the unique opportunity offered by K2 to observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed during the nominal mission, thus benefiting from better independent constraints (parallaxes, spectroscopy, interferometry). This will make it possible to bring the full potential of asteroseismology to bear to test the physics of stellar interiors. To constrain our analysis further we plan for a spectroscopic follow-up of the proposed targets. By combining the targets observed 
during C14-16 with those from previous K2 campaigns that possess independent constraints we may calibrate seismic scaling relations. This will be essential in seismic galactic archaeology studies, which rely on the application of these relations. Including also targets from the nominal mission, we may study the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood and place constraints on the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars. The results will be used in ongoing investigations that are relevant to this solicitation: - In C16, M44 and M67 will be re-observed, allowing us to combine new observations with those made during C5, from which solar-like oscillations have been detected for both clusters. M44 is similar to the Hyades for which [1] from C4 observations provided the first ever detections of MS solar-like oscillators in an open cluster. C16 is furthermore forward facing, allowing for contemporaneous observations from the SONG network. Such observations are vital to better understand the relations between observations in photometry and velocity.   - The targets will further expand the sample of benchmark stars having precise fundamental properties from asteroseismology to different fields in the Galaxy, which will be crucial to calibrate surveys as Gaia and the upcoming GALAH.

We estimate requesting for 30-50 targets per campaign. These should show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes, hence SC data are required for detecting the oscillations. We will prepare analysis-ready light curves from pixel-data using in-house software - these will be made available to the community via the KASOC portal. We will apply well-tested analysis procedures to the frequency-power spectra of the light curves, providing both estimates of global seismic parameters and individual modes of oscillation. Detailed modelling using state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes will then provide the stellar properties.  The methodology delineated above has already been successfully applied to the analysis of K2 C1-8 data, for which we reached a very good understanding of the seismic detection yield - from targets awarded in C0-3, [2] showed a detection yield >73%. From C3-5 data we have found that solar-like oscillations can be detected for stars similar to the Sun, with characteristic frequencies around 3100uHz. We have also successfully extracted individual frequencies for these stars, hence enabling detailed seismic modelling [2].

One module in Campaign 15 observations will overlap with Campaign 2, while 30% of the field of Campaign 16 overlaps with Campaign 5. These fields provide unique opportunities beyond those of a typical K2 field. First, the three-year time baseline of observations provide an opportunity to detect transit timing variations (TTVs), which can be used to confirm the planetary nature of transit signals in the K2 data. The observed TTV signal from interacting planets can grow quadratically in time: planetary systems that may have an apparent linear ephemeris in 75 days of data could show significant TTVs over three years. In the cases when both planets transit, this can enable us to infer masses, densities, and eccentricities for both planets in the system. TTVs can also be used to infer the presence of non-transiting planets in the Kepler data by detecting perturbations on observed planets that cannot be explained by other transiting planets in the system.  The K2 overlap regions also provide the opportunity to detect the smallest planets found by K2. The overlap regions provide 40 square degrees of the sky which will be observed for a total of 150 days, rather than the 75 days of a typical K2 field, enabling the detection of smaller planets that would be below the signal-to-noise threshold of a single K2 campaign. These observations will enable us to detect smaller planets in systems with known planet candidates. Moreover, by re-observing targets from Campaigns 2 and 5 with transit signals below the standard 7.1 sigma threshold for detection, we will have additional opportunities to detect planets smaller than can be observed in any single K2 Campaign.

Additionally, the K2 overlap regions allow us to confirm and precisely measure the periods of long-period planets. Planets with one transit in the K2 data have poorly constrained periods; two planets of near-equal size can masquerade as one planet if only two transits are observed. With a longer time baseline, these planets can be confirmed and their ephemerides precisely measured.

There are 8,362 targets in common between Campaigns 2/5 and 15/16. We will propose to observe a subset of these targets. We will propose all 75 objects of interest detected with our pipeline (Luger et al. 2016, AJ, 152, 100; Kruse et al. in prep), which includes multi-candidate systems with as many as 5 transiting planets. Additionally, we will propose all stars with one or two observed transit events in order to confirm these planets and refine their orbits. We will also propose stars with candidate signals consistent with the presence of small planets which could be detected with an additional 75 days of observations. These observations will enable K2 to detect its smallest planets yet, confirm the planetary nature of any systems with detected TTV signals, and possibly detect non-transiting planets through their interactions with transiting planets."
GO15012,15,Philip,Steven,Muirhead,Boston University,philipm@bu.edu,"Skinner, Julie N",Activity and Planets at the Bottom of the Main-Sequence,"We propose to continue a K2 program to observe a carefully selected sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) with K2 during Campaigns 14, 15, and 16. UCDs occupy the transition from main-sequence stars to brown dwarfs (late-M and later) and are essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the lowest mass objects in the Universe. Historically, photometric monitoring of UCDs for transiting planets and rotational spot modulation has been hampered by their intrinsic faintness and the expected short duration of transit events. The K2 spacecraft provides an excellent opportunity to study these objects in more detail, thanks to the large aperture and near-continuous 80-day photometric coverage of each K2 field.  Searching for Transiting Planets Orbiting UCDs: The discovery of transiting planets (TRAPPIST-1) orbiting a UCD has had significant implications for the field of exoplanets.  However, the larger population of exoplanets around these small, cool objects remains unprobed and will provide important constraints on planet formation around the smallest dwarfs.  UCDs are small, all roughly the diameter of Jupiter, which implies deep fractional transit signatures. UCDs are also relatively bright in the infrared. A planet that transits a UCD, whether gaseous or rocky, would be an ideal target for near-infrared transit transmission spectroscopy, as has been successfully performed on super Earths orbiting mid-M dwarf stars with the Hubble Space Telescope. Future transit transmission observations with NASAs James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets, but only for those planets that transit ultra-cool dwarfs. The transits from rocky planets orbiting mid-M and earlier dwarf stars are simply not deep enough to search for biosignatures over the expected lifetime of JWST. Recent studies of short-period planet occurrence around early- and mid-M dwarfs show that lower mass stars have significantly more rocky short-period planets than Sun-like stars. Extrapolating to ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect a large fraction, if not all UCDs to harbor rocky planets with transit probabilities of ~10%.  Spot morphology at the M/L transition: Studies indicate that over 90% of UCDs show evidence of surface activity in the form of H± emission; however, the nature of the activity is not fully understood. Unlike sun-like stars, UCDs have fully convective interiors and are expected to have magnetic field morphologies markedly different from the Sun. With precise photometric monitoring of UCDs with K2 we will measure the morphology of spots on the surfaces of UCDs via light curve inversion. We will also search for flare events and correlate those flare events to specific spots structures.  Surface activity in UCDs is related to stellar wind and ultraviolet emission from their chromospheres, both of which affect the photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets. Understanding the nature of surface activity on UCDs is therefore critical for interpreting transit-transmission spectroscopy, as well as inferring the habitability of any detected planets. K2 provides a unique opportunity to study ultra-cool dwarfs in a way never before realized."
GO15013,15,Teo,,Mocnik,Keele University,t.mocnik@keele.ac.uk,"Southworth, John; Hellier, Coel","Short-cadence observations of WASP-104, K2-38 and K2-34","We propose to observe three planetary systems in the short-cadence observing mode: WASP-104 (Smith et al. 2014, Campaign 14), K2-38 (Sinukoff et al. 2016, Campaign 15) and K2-34 (Hirano et al. 2016, Lillo-Box et al. 2016, Campaign 16).

WASP-104 hosts a transiting hot Jupiter with a short orbital period of 1.8d. According to the current system parameters and assuming the optical geometric albedo of 0.1, this short-period planet should produce reflectional phase-curve modulation with a semi-amplitude of ~27ppm. For a bright (V=11.1) and photometrically quiet host star, such reflectional modulation should be detectable using K2 photometry. Although the previous ground based photometric observations placed a 4mmag upper limit on rotational modulation, the stellar G8 spectral type suggests that some starspots could still be present. If so, the short-cadence observations may reveal starspot occultation events, a valuable detection for determining precise stellar rotational period and obliquity.

K2-38 has been observed by the K2 during the observing Campaign 2 in the long-cadence observing mode, which resulted in the discovery of a transiting hot super-Earth and a hot sub-Neptune. This compact planetary configuration is an ideal candidate to search for transit-timing variations. The 1-min short-cadence is essential as it provides a much improved precision of individual transits' timing measurements compared to long-cadence.

K2-34 is transited by a slightly inflated hot Jupiter, which was discovered using the K2 long-cadence photometry from the observing Campaign 5. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain why some of the planets are inflated, and expanding the sample of inflated planets with accurate parameters is of particular interest. The K2 Campaign 5 lightcurve has indicated a possible rotational modulation with a period of 19d. Additional photometric dataset would put this detection to the test. Since rotational modulations are caused by the presence of starspots, the short-cadence K2 lightcurve may exhibit any potential starspot occultation events.

In addition to science goals mentioned above, the research of all three planetary systems would benefit from the short-cadence K2 observations in several aspects: refinement of system parameters with improved precision, search for transit-timing variations, additional transiting planets, phase-curve modulation, starspot occultations and rotational modulation.

Our team has developed a data reduction procedure to correct the drift artefacts from the K2 short-cadence lightcurves to restore the near-original Kepler-like photometric precision (Mocnik et al. 2016). We also have experience with K2 short-cadence data analysis."
GO15014,15,Aleks,,Scholz,University of St Andrews,as110@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Peterson, Dawn E; Matt, Sean P; Stelzer, Beate; Damasso, Mario","Rotation of M dwarfs: spindown, activity, and gyrochronology","Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter for the evolution of stars and planets. Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy.  Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012). For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission.  The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars.  Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem.  Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013).  Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. Several hundred of them (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields from 2014 to 2017. We have successfully applied for time in previous campaigns and the lightcurves for campaigns 0-5 are fully analysed and the paper is published  (Stelzer et al., A&A, 2016). The analysis for campaigns 6-9 is underway, observations for campaign 11-13 are approved. For fields 14-16, we propose to include again about 100 targets in the K2 fields for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them will fall onto the Kepler chips. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner using the procedures developed for previous campaigns."
GO15015,15,Tabetha,Suzanne,Boyajian,Louisiana State University,boyajian@lsu.edu,"Vanderburg, Andrew",Extending the K2 Exoplanet Legacy by Re-Observing Previous K2 Targets in Campaigns 15 and 16,"K2 observes new a field every campaign, which means that K2 can observe large numbers of bright stars and can potentially find many planets, but it also means that K2 is generally unable to follow-up on its own discoveries. Occasionally, however, K2 re-observes portions of the sky that it has already surveyed, so it is possible to use existing K2 data to plan future observations. We propose Cycle 5 K2 observations of targets observed in previous K2 campaigns, with a particular focus on stars hosting transiting planet candidates. During Cycle 5, portions of Fields 2 and 5 will be reobserved (during Campaigns 15 and 16, respectively). We have produced light curves of stars that could be re-observed during Cycle 5 and searched both by eye and by an automated pipeline to identify planet candidates and interesting variables. We propose short-cadence observations of some of the more interesting planet candidates which would benefit most from improved sampling.

Observing targets across multiple campaigns brings a number of benefits. Chiefly, it allows improved constraints on the timing of periodic signals like transiting planets. Additionally, knowing about planet candidates before K2 observations makes short cadence observations of interesting candidates possible, which can significantly improve transit parameters and can reveal transit-timing variations.  Lastly, the longer duration of observations allows for study the evolution of phenomena (like stellar magnetic activity) that vary on timescales longer than a single campaign.

Module 2 of Field 15 overlaps nearly entirely with Module 23 of Field 2, and almost 30% of Field 5 overlaps with Field 16. We have reduced light curves from these overlapping regions following Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) and searched for transiting planets using the methodology of Vanderburg et al. (2016). In addition, we visually inspected each overlapping light curve by eye to find planet candidates missed by our automated search (including planet candidates with single or few transits), and also to find other interesting or noteworthy variable stars such as young dipper stars (e.g. Ansdell et al. 2016).  We propose short-cadence observations of several systems. One of these systems is K2-38 (Sinukoff et al. 2016), a two-planet system around a bright solar-type star, which already has an RV mass measurement. Short cadence observations will improve the measurement of the planet radius, giving better constraints on the planets bulk composition. Other systems for which we propose short cadence observations include several planetary systems in Praesepe (Mann et al. 2016). Short cadence observations of these stars will improve transit parameters and could yield spin/orbit alignment information from starspot crossing events."

Additionally, we propose long-cadence observations of hundreds of known and candidate white dwarfs, many of which are known to be magnetic, in close binaries, or harbor remnant planetary systems.

Overall, our program will more than quadruple the number of rotation rates measured for white dwarfs, putting strong constraints on the evolution of angular momentum in the final stages of stellar evolution. We will also characterize the orbital periods of many new post-common-envelope binaries (close WD+dM), informing Type Ia supernova population synthesis models. The proposed observations will provide the capstone for our legacy dataset of white dwarf variability with K2, which will revolutionize our understanding of stellar remnants for the next decade."

Like gas giant planets, very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs form condensate clouds in their atmospheres. For the nearest ultracool dwarfs, K2 can uniquely characterize variability due to these clouds, both rotation modulation on a timescale of hours and weather evolution of the clouds on timescales from days to months. Magnetic activity changes dramatically at the stellar/substellar hydrogen-burning limits. We have already demonstrated that ultracool dwarfs can generate white light flares and superflares in our previous Kepler and K2 campaigns, but increasing the sample size is important to constraint the rate of these rare events as a function of effective temperature and age. Flares are tied to magnetic reconnection rates and the energy budget. We also aim to detect transiting exoplanets by continuing to monitor each available ultracool dwarf in K2 campaigns; brown dwarfs, gas giants, and even large rocky planets are detectable. The K2 targets include nearby field late-M and L dwarfs, and even faint targets are valuable, since transits may be total and flares can be 20-40 times the photosphere in the Kepler filter. Campaign 15 includes the key target 2MASSW J1507476-162738, a bright L5 dwarf at 7.2 pc."
GO15019,15,Elme,,Breedt,University of Warwick,E.Breedt@warwick.ac.uk,,Accretion disc variability in Cataclysmic Variables,"Accretion discs are a common occurrence in the universe. They exist on physical scales spanning orders of magnitude, ranging from the parsec scale discs which power active galactic nuclei to protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (few thousand km). The flow of material and angular momentum through these discs are governed by the same underlying physical processes, but timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion discs around cataclysmic variables (CVs) are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure and the effects of accretion rate variations, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Continuing our programme from campaigns 0 to 13, we propose to monitor the CVs and X-ray binaries in the K2 fields with the aim of building a library of high quality light curves that can be used to investigate disc-based phenomena. CVs and other accreting compact objects display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days). The unique capability of Kepler/K2 to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is key to understand accretion and accretion variability over such a wide range of timescales.

We will request 40 targets in Cycle 5, in a mix of long and short cadence mode."
GO15020,15,Elisabeth,Rose,Adams,Planetary Science Institute,adams@psi.edu,"Law, Nicholas M; Jackson, Brian K; Endl, Michael",Ultra-short-period planets in K2,"Ultra-Short-Period Planets in K2 Science Goals and Objectives  Ultra-short-period planets (those with orbits of a day or less) pose a severe challenge to theories of planet formation and evolution, but they also provide a wealth of observational constraints on planetary composition, internal structure, and more. For instance, the only rocky exoplanets for which mass estimates have been made (except for the few fortuitous systems that exhibit transit-timing variations) are those in ultra-short period orbits  Kepler-10 b and Kepler-78 b are two famous examples. Moreover, understanding the origins of ultra-short period planets may elucidate key processes in formation and evolution. Gas disk migration may have brought the objects in from where they formed but would require disks extending to nearly the stellar surfaces, contrary to observations and theoretical expectations that stellar magnetospheres truncate gas disks much farther out. On the other hand, if such planets were scattered in by dynamical interactions with other planets in the system, then we would expect to find additional planets around most stars with ultra-short-period planets, making those systems good targets for follow-up radial velocity searches. Furthermore, ultra-short-period planets that are the cores of evaporated hot Jupiters are likely much denser than planets similar to Earth that were scattered in, offering a way to test the frequency of each theoretical formation method -- if the targets are bright enough for us to collect high-precision radial velocity data to measure the mass.

We propose to collect photometric observations of stars that may host ultra-short period planets (with periods < 1 day) using the K2 mission. We will convert the raw K2 images into light curves and search for transits. We will follow up putative transit candidates with spectral, radial velocity, and high-spatial resolution observations to continue the already fruitful and exciting search for ultra-short period planets. All candidates and their suitability for followup will be regularly published and updated online for the general community.

Targets  Our targets are bright main-sequence G-M stars, select specifically so they will be most suitable for radial velocity (RV) mass measurements. All targets have been checked to fall on K2 silicon (code 2). We request that our targets be observed even if this proposal is not selected for funding.

Methodology  For Task 1, we will generate photometric time series from the raw K2 images, and the Kepler PyKE python package provides the necessary capabilities, based on Vanderburg & Johnson (2014). For Task 2, we will detrend light curves and apply an automated search algorithm (EEBLS  Kovacs et al., 2002) to find transits, as we have with previous campaigns (Adams et al. 2016). We will also perform photometric and pixel-level analyses to vet candidate signals. For Task 3, for vetted candidates, we will characterize host stars and collect RV observations using low-precision spectra to rule out binaries and blend scenarios. For available targets, we will collect and analyze precise RVs from the HRS spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory to confirm candidates as planets and estimate their masses. For targets inaccessible from McDonald, we will propose for follow-up observations at another suitable facility (e.g. Keck). We will also conduct high-spatial resolution observations using the Robo-AO system to rule out possible blend scenarios masquerading as planets and to get accurate stellar and planetary parameters.

Relevance  This proposal will use the unique capabilities of the K2 mission to look for an unusual and astrophysically compelling class of planet.

We will discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  Our K2 samples will also be useful for planet occurrence measurements to detect variations in the prevalence of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood.  This Cycle 5 request for Campaigns 14, 15, 16 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in Campaigns 0-13 (PIs Howard, Sanchis-Ojeda, Petigura, and Winn) that constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.  We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts.  Here we request magnitude-limited samples of Fields 14-16 comprising approximately 10,000 stars each in long-cadence mode.  We will continue our search for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013).  We catalog the planets discovered, their orbital and physical properties, and their host star characteristics, as in the recent catalog by our team (Crossfield et al. 2016) that found 197 planet candidates and 104 validated planets in K2 Campaigns 0-4.

We will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES, the Automated Planet Finder at Lick Observatory, and other facilities.  We were awarded a NASA-Keck Key Project specifically to measure K2 planet masses using 40 nights on Keck-HIRES. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultra-short-period Earths.  Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission.

Much of exoplanet science hinges on a thorough understanding of the planets host star. As a result of the push toward lower mass and more widely separated exoplanets, it has become increasingly important to properly characterize exoplanet hosts and efficiently distinguish the signals from planets from signals from the star itself. Currently, stellar physical processes on the surfaces of stars poses a major deterrent to our ability to detect exoplanets. In radial velocity (RV) measurements, these processes induce noise, coined jitter, that can imitate or drown out the signals of planets. As new transiting planets are discovered by K2 and TESS, it will be imperative to have new methods of prioritizing ground-based RV follow-up, especially given that Kepler alone provided more planet candidates than can be followed-up in a reasonable time-frame with all ground-based resources combined. By accurately predicting the level of stellar jitter of a host star, we can readily identify the most promising targets for both the RV follow-up of transiting planet candidates and the RV discovery of new exoplanets. 
	We propose to use the high-precision light curves from the K2 mission with archival RV jitter and activity measurements to (1) develop an empirical relation between RV jitter and light curve variations, following the methodology developed by Bastien et al. (2014) and (2) determine the dependency of the relation on age, spectral type, and magnetic activity. These relations will prove useful for RV follow-up of existing transiting exoplanet candidates. We will use them to identify targets that have low levels of RV jitter and use them to uncover the physical causes of RV jitter, which will help optimize the use of upcoming RV facilities like NASAs NEID spectrograph.  2.	Description of Methodology to be Used
Bastien et al. (2014) showed that short-timescale light curve variations, called flicker are strongly correlated with RV jitter for magnetically inactive stars. Current work involves extending this relation from the 12 California Planet Survey (CPS) stars in the Kepler field to stars in the K2 campaigns. Due to the multiple fields of the K2 mission, there is larger overlap between CPS stars and potential K2 targets. Past and future K2 campaigns (0-11) have increased the initial CPS-Kepler sample by nearly 50 stars. Here we have identified roughly 30 stars across Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 of the K2 mission with existing RV time series from CPS, which will provide further refinement of this empirical relation. More importantly, they will allow coverage over a wider range of spectral types, ages, and activity levels. Thus, we will be able to fully explore the photometric manifestations of RV jitter and develop the tools necessary for improved RV target selection in a timeframe suitable for the upcoming space missions and ground-based instruments, such as the TESS mission or the NEID spectrograph."

A major result from surveys for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars.  This trend is not seen, however, around super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al 2015).  We propose to search a large sample of sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] < 0.0) stars in the fields of K2 GO Cycle 5 Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 for transiting planets of all sizes.  Stars in this metallicity range fall into three populations: a) the thin-disk (which also extends into super-solar metallicity), b) the thick-disk, and c) the halo (which extends to extremely metal poor stars). These three populations differ both kinematically and chemically.  Thick disk stars exhibit a larger vertical scale height in the galactic orbits, and they also show alpha-capture element abundances enhanced by about a factor of two over thin-disk stars.  Halo stars show even more extreme kinematics and also exhibit significant enhancement of alpha-capture elements.  K2 field 14, being located at high galactic latitude, will be especially important for its larger fraction of thick disk and halo stars than are found in fields at lower galactic latitude. The discovery of the Kepler-444 system (Campante et al 2015), which comprises five sub-Earth size planets orbiting an ancient (11.2 Gy age) thick-disk star with significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe=H]=-0.69 +/- 0.09 dex) shows that planet formation started very early in the history of the galaxy.  We will obtain the data necessary to compute planet occurrence rates for stars as a function of stellar metallicity, stellar population and of planet radius.  For stellar metallicity, we will consider not just the standard [Fe/H] abundance, but also the abundance of the very important alpha-capture elements.  The goal of our program is to determine the characteristics of the first stars in our Galaxy to form potentially habitable planetary systems.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W.  Cochran) and the European KESPRINT consortium (represented in this proposal by Dr. M. Fridlund) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.

Targets:
We will propose a large sample of 2952 targets.  They range in V magnitude from about 6.4 to 12.4, with a median magnitude of 10.3.  Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2015, MNRAS, 247, 2880) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 80 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems. These results will provide important new constraints on the physics and chemistry of planetary system formation, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes and photometry, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? In order to answer this question, we need to understand their multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates.   The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above. Because of the limited precision on the ground based observations to measure rotation periods, we propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates as one of the key approaches to solve the width problem. In K2 fields 14, 15 and 16, we will observe 22 nearby systems, including two K dwarfs and 20 M dwarfs. One of the systems is GJ406, which is the closest dwarf at only 2.6pc among all K2 campaigns. By combing stars previously observed by K2, we have a total of 74 stars within 25 pc in K2 campaigns. We expect to have the most complete characterization of a set of the nearest K and M stars in all K2 campaigns that have ever been accomplished."

Stellar clusters provide a homogeneous sample of stars in which the major independent variable is the stellar mass. The different ages of the clusters will help us to understand the early dynamical evolution of planetary systems. We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team. The PICK2 project has already collected K2 data on the Hyades, Pleiades, Praesepe and Ruprecht 147 clusters. In K2 campaign 16 we will be able to observe different - and previously unexplored - parts of the M67 and Praesepe open clusters.

o) Methods & techniques:
We will search the K2 light curves for planetary transit signatures. We will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, and high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates. We will perform detailed spectral analysis in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Our team has just discovered a transiting super-giant planet or brown dwarf in the Ruprecht 147 cluster (Nowak et al. 2016) and has confirmed several new K2 planets (Johnson et al. 2016; Barragan et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2016) o) Perceived significance:
These results will provide important new constraints on the physics of planetary system formation and early dynamical evolution.

GO15032,15,Michele,,Montgomery,University of Central Florida,montgomery@physics.ucf.edu,"Voloshina, Irina; Olenick, Richard P",Evolutionary Paths of AM CVn's to Supernovae,"Of the most probable paths to supernova type I, three involve AM CVn systems, which are close binary systems where the primary member is a white dwarf. The secondary could be another white dwarf (i.e., a double-degenerate channel), the core of an evolved, once hydrogen-rich main sequence star [i.e., a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) channel], or a semi-degenerate helium star (i.e., a helium star channel). The probabilities to the three paths and identification of a particular path for a known AM CVn system are not well known. Recently we have identified several parameters that are predicted to identify the paths and even go further as to eliminate a path for a particular AM CVn system. Necessary for study of these parameters are observations of light curves, and in particular quiescence to and through Stage A of a superoutburst that is nearly always missed from ground-based observations. As such, we have a limited sample to confirm our predictions using ground-based data. Necessary are the observations we propose for K2 Cycle 5, Campaigns 14-16 for both AM CVn systems and CV systems. We need to observe CV systems so we can differentiate between the evolutionary path of a normal CV (i.e., white dwarf primary and main sequence or evolved secondary) and the CV channel for AM CVn systems. For all observations, we will simultaneously observe from the ground in the R band using the Sternberg Astronomical Observatory and in the V band using the University of Dallas at Texas observatories. We have put together a national and international team of experts to achieve these goals. This project will involve undergraduate student observers using ground-based telescopes."
GO15033,15,Bernard,Scott,Gaudi,The Ohio State University,gaudi@astronomy.ohio-state.edu,"Paetzold, Martin; Cochran, William D.; Shporer, Avi; Csizmadia, Szilard; Johnson, Marshall C; Eigmueller, Philipp; Grziwa, Sascha",Probing the Planetary Population of High-Mass Stars (K2-GO5),"Objectives: To date most planet searches have been confined to stars of spectral type F and later, as hotter stars have fewer spectral lines and tend to be rapidly rotating, making precise radial velocity (RV) observations difficult. By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can help to expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiants and giants in this mass range [1], but the masses of these stars have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus ~60 planet candidates that are awaiting validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement (sub)giant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets, and close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the (sub)giants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars. There are currently only ~20 such confirmed planets; this population is currently almost totally unexplored. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2.

Targets: We request 301 long cadence targets, ~1/2 of which will be in Field 16. This will build on the ~1500 targets we have been granted earlier in the K2 mission. The sample consists of A and early F-type dwarfs with 8<V<13, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: We will extract lightcurves of our targets from the K2 pixel data, correct these for systematics, and search for transit signals. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m telescope at McDonald Observatory and the forthcoming NRES spectrographs for the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network, and high-resolution imaging with Robo-AO and the Large Binocular Telescope. For long-period targets with only 2 or 3 transits in the K2 data, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with LCO and the DEMONEXT robotic 0.5m telescope. Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other methods. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (where we spectroscopically resolve the stellar line profile perturbation during the transit due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit [5]. We will use the statistical techniques developed to validate Kepler planets for any candidates not amenable to phase curve detection or Doppler tomography.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

Two complementary approaches have been adopted, the first centered on in-depth studies of the Sun itself, and the second focusing on the study of solar analogs, stars which are like the Sun and thus might shed light on characteristics of its composition, structure, activity, planetary system, evolution, and future. The utility of the study of solar analogs is broad, ranging from finding night-time proxies for the Sun for calibration purposes to their use as snapshots of the evolutionary history of the Sun. Their study has helped to establish that chromospheric activity is key to understanding stellar rotation, activity, and dynamos. The project proposed here is aimed at providing a large consistent set of well-vetted solar analogs in order to address these questions. We will make use of the K2 mission fields to obtain precise photometric time series of approximately 1000 solar analogs, supplemented by asteroseismology and ground- and space-based spectroscopic data for the brighter and more promising candidates. From this data we will derive rotation periods, spot coverages, and flare rates for a well-calibrated sample of solar analogs. This work expands and extends our ongoing Kepler and K2 analysis, and supports an ongoing project under NASA's Living With a Star program; the use of new fields will also allow us to compare different stellar populations and provide a growing sample of test data for the study of stellar activity, rotation, and dynamos.

The chosen targets will be selected on the basis of existing ground-based photometry supplemented by spectroscopy when available and guided by previous results and population models using TRILEGAL. We anticipate that <10% of the stars in our sample will be giants, but we can make use of light curves and power spectra to eliminate giants from our sample after the fact based on granulation noise (Mathur et al. 2011, Bastien et al. 2013, 2015). We will reduce our limiting magnitude from the ~14 we used for Kepler to ~12.5 to roughly compensate for the increased noise in K2 compared to Kepler, and make ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up easier."

E.",Dynamical Activity in Algol-Type Interacting Binaries,"We propose K2 photometry of 18 binaries with Algol-type light curves in Campaign (C) Fields 14-16 to study gas stream impact and spot dynamics that influence the evolution of these systems. Most early-type stars begin as binary or multiple star systems, so an understanding the evolution of the Algol systems is critical for a more general knowledge of massive star and galactic evolution. All but one observation will be in the long cadence mode. In C16 we will have the opportunity to revisit three interesting binaries that were observed in K2 C5 and look for long-term variability. One system, S Cnc, for which we propose short cadence coverage is a well studied late-term Algol that displays a total eclipse. We plan to apply for observing time at KPNO to obtain spectra that will support the K2 observations, especially those in C16. The K2 mission and the modeling capabilities of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary system analysis program present a unique opportunity to probe gas stream dynamics and/or magnetic activity from the recently discovered quadrature brightness variations in Algol binaries that we call L/T variables. L/T is the flux ratio between the quadrature flux at phase 0.25 to that at phase 0.75 (Leading and Trailing hemispheres on the primary star). The L/T phenomenon was discovered in Kepler data and has never been reported in ground-based photometry. L/T behavior is likely due to changes in either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the impact site's location and movement can be diagnostic of stream dynamics that may be modulated by magnetic fields. In the cool spot scenario the variability is a consequence of magnetic activity on the mass loser. New data from K2 Cycle 5 will improve our statistical study of the percentage of Algols that show L/T inequality and indicate whether there is a preference for L > T or the reverse.   Modeling the K2 light curves with the WD program, stellar and spot parameters, including spot motions, will be determined so as to generate an image of the binary versus time.  Updates to the WD program will be made available to the community."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is known about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. In addition, the detection of eclipsing stellar companions is of high interest for stellar astrophysics, because it allows one to directly measure the mass and radius of a star, which in turn calibrates the fundamental ""mass-radius relationship"", which is a critical test of stellar structure and evolution models. We expect our proposed program to discover several of these important mass-radius calibrators, which would for the first time obtain mass and radius measurements for old, low-mass stars with low metal abundances. Our ongoing program has now identified three likely eclipsing binaries in K2 campaigns 4-7, out of 6,376 halo stars monitored. The small numbers shows how rare these systems are in the halo population, and emphasizes the need for monitoring larger samples of halo stars. Campaigns 14-15-16 are very favorable to this, with campaign 14 close to the North Galactic cap. Our astrometric and photometric analysis of these three fields identifies 3,959 high-velocity subdwarfs, which are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, in order to attempt once more to identify and characterize the first generations of exoplanets in our Galaxy, and to identify additional eclipsing systems to be used as mass-radius calibrators. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits using an auto-correlation and Fourier analysis method developed by our team. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based follow-up observations, to confirm the existence of the transits/eclipses. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."

The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak or completely absent discrete spectral features leaves us with only continuum variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F14, 15 and 16 fields of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of less than 100 objects with Kep magnitude < 18 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip that are not previously identified blazars. The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density on timescales from minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to lengthen the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies."
GO15041,15,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,Rotation rates for stars in wide binary systems and a search for hierarchical triples in Kepler K2 campaigns 14-15-16.,"Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and presumably have very similar chemical compositions. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated, which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are. Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 14, 15, and 16, we have identified a total of 194 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 60. Our statistical analysis indicates that >90% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignments of unrelated stars). About half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. A majority of the  secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, many pairs can be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target (or may use fewer pixels overall). One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, which means that a significant fraction of wide binaries may actually be hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or eclipsing) binary star; this prediction will be directly tested with K2, by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries in those pairs."

The association consists of three subgroups: Upper Scorpius (US 11 Myr), Upper Centaurus Lupus (UCL 15-20 Myr) and Lower-Centaurus-Crux (LCC 15-20 Myr), which contain ~800 B, A and F-type stars and based on IMF extrapolation, ~10000 lower mass stars which are mostly unidentified. The vast majority of pre main sequence stars in the nearest 200 pc volume are thus comoving Sco-Cen members waiting to be found.  The K2 mission is ideal for measuring planet formation timescales and migration pathways. Over the completed and planned campaigns, multiple groups of young stars have been or will be observed by K2, ranging from ~2 Myr old Taurus star forming, through the ~120 Myr old Pleiades, and the ~600 Myr old Hyades moving group. The detected, and soon to be detected exoplanets in these samples of different age will reveal the evolution of the exoplanet population in the early stages of stellar life. The K2 mission has also already observed the Upper Scorpius subgroup with very fruitful results: We identified the current youngest transiting exoplanet, hosted by an Upper Sco M-type star K2-33 b (Mann et al., 2016) and multiple eclipsing binaries were characterized (e.g., Kraus et al., 2015, David et al., 2015).

We propose to use K2 in campaign 15, in long-cadence mode, to search further confirmed and probable Upper Scorpius and UCL members for young transiting exoplanets. We have already developed tools, which we have applied to existing data, to extract lightcurves from K2 data and remove instrumental systematics. We have also developed methods for removing stellar activity signals from the lightcurves of young stars, and have identified candidate transiting exoplanets in the K2 Upper Scorpius data from campaign 2. We have planned a robust follow-up campaign for any detected Sco-Cen planets, utilizing a full suite of techniques including multi-band ground based photometry to confirm the planetary nature of the transits, and high-resolution imaging and IR spectroscopy to detect stellar companions.  We also expect to discover ~5 eclipsing binary systems in the proposed sample, which, with ground based follow-up, will offer revolutionary constraints at the youngest reaches of the pre-main sequence evolutionary models. We are already following up 10 eclipsing binaries in Upper Scorpius from K2 campaign 2, and a further 20 in older nearby clusters. We will add any new eclipsing binaries in Sco-Cen from C15 to this program.  We have built a complete census of confirmed Sco-Cen members from all of the existing literature and our own spectroscopic confirmation, and have supplemented this with a kinematic search for high confidence candidate new members (following the method of Rizzuto et al. 2011,2015). In total, we propose to observe 578 targets with 9<Kp<18 that fall on K2 silicon, 167 confirmed members, and 411 candidate new members selected on the basis of their kinematics and photometry. Our targets list is the most complete sample of Sco-Cen stars ever compiled."

As illustrated by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, asteroseismology of solar-like stars is an efficient method to measure masses, radii, and ages of large numbers of stars, which is of prime importance to test stellar evolution. However, a crucial test of both asteroseismic masses and radii of a large sample of stars with independent measurements of those quantities has not yet been carried out. Eclipsing binary systems (EBs) potentially permit such an exercise by allowing for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, provided that spectral lines are detectable for both components (e.g., Gaulme et al. 2016).  EBs are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough. As an example, Gaulme et al. 2014 noticed that among red giants belonging to EBs about a third do not display oscillations. They showed the shorter the orbital period and the closer the stars are, the weaker the oscillation modes become, until complete mode depletion is reached. This is observed in the closest systems where rotational and orbital periods are almost synchronized and where strong surface activity is detected. Beyond solar-like oscillators, the Kepler mission led to a much clearer understanding of the oscillation spectra of classical pulsators as RR-Lyrae, gamma-Doradus or delta-Scuti stars (e.g., Keen et al. 2015, Ouazzani et al. 2015, Kurtz et al. 2016). As patterns in the mode distributions are becoming clearer and inference on these stars improve, a similar need for ``benchmarks'' become important. Observing stars that likely pulsate and belong to eclipsing binaries are precious targets for studying stellar evolution in the common multiple evolution configuration.  In the field of views of campaign 14, 15, and 16, we have identified a set of binary systems with components that are likely on the instability strip, displaying oscillations from Beta Ceph to Delta Scuti, and maybe even solar-like oscillations. We will propose this set to be observed in the main proposal. Long cadence will be enough for most of the systems.  No funding will be requested.

Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approx. 25% at circa 1 Gyr, Zuckerman et al.2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.  The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically significant (1000 to 1500) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a significant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).  A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al.(2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al.(2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD? This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery.

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm(5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 177, 17 and 242 WDs (campaigns 14, 15 and 16), that have been spectroscopically identified or are deemed to have a 60% or greater probability of being a WD (Fusillo et al. 2015), and which are brighter than Kepler Magnitude 19.5 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues."

Thanks to its fast photometric cadence, continuous monitoring and high photometric accuracy, Kepler has provided unprecedented insights into various types of compact binaries, and holds an enormous potential for other astrophysical domains on top of planet hunting. Some of the most notable studies have revealed i) the mass ratio and precise orbital parameters through Doppler beaming and Romer delays for compact binaries (Bloemen et al. 2011, MNRAS,410, 178), ii) stringent tests to the disk instability model through the precise characterization of dwarf nova (DN) outburst cycles and (Cannizzo et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 117), iii) a plethora of currently unexplained periodicities in the AM CVn system SDSS J190817.07+394036.4 (Kupfer et al. 2015, MNRAS, 453, 483), iv) the discovery of the rms-flux relation in the aperiodic flickering of accreting white dwarfs (WD, Scaringi et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 2854), v) the discovery of a universal scaling relation linking the timing properties of Active Galactic Nuclei, accreting stellar-mass black holes, accreting white dwarfs and young-stellar objects (Scaringi et al. 2015, Sci.

Here we propose to carry on this program to continue exploiting the capabilities of Kepler/K2, and specifically ask to observe 4 targets (3 SC and 1 LC) in Campaign 14, 3 (2 SC and 1 LC) in Campaign 15 and 3 (2 SC and 1 LC) in Campaign 16. Most targets have been selected from the Ritter & Kolb catalogue (A&A, 404, 301). The exact target list will be defined on submission of the Step 2 proposal. For all targets in our sample we will probe their broad-band variability properties. Together with similar targets observed during the previous K2 campaigns, this will form the most comprehensive study of optical aperiodic variability in accreting compact objects, and provide a legacy dataset for years to come."
GO15051,15,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transit,"To date almost nothing is known about the final (WD) configuration of planetary systems.
Although not a single bona-fide planet orbiting an isolated WD has yet been identified, it is now widely accepted that the dusty and/or gaseous disks that we see within one solar radius around many WDs are produced by the tidal disruption of asteroids (Farihi+2010, MNRAS 404, 2123). Recently, a disintegrating minor planet transiting a white dwarf has been detected (Vanderburg+2015, Nature 526, 546; Croll+2015, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06434v1.pdf). An increasing fraction of WDs (>=27%) show a metal enrichment due to the fall into the WD atmosphere of ancient planetary material (Koester+2014, A&A 566, 34), whose chemical composition is similar to that seen in different Solar-system meteorites (Gansicke+2012, MNRAS 424, 333).
Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and the AGB phases (Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). While Gaia will discover WD planets at several AUs from their host stars, those external to the period gap (Silvotti+2015, ASPC 493, 455), this proposal aims to study the inner boundary of the period gap. Substellar companions to sdB stars offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion, thermal pulses and PN ejection, Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ 761, 121), and they are the natural 1st step to study the post-RGB evolution of planetary systems and their final architecture. Star/planet interactions during the RGB may be responsible for the stellar envelope ejection leading to the formation of a single sdB star (Soker 1998, AJ 116, 1308; Han+2012, ASPC 452, 3).
Among the first planet/BD candidates around sdB stars (Silvotti+2014, ASPC 481, 13), 2 planetary systems were detected by Kepler measuring the photometric modulation due to reflection/re-emission of the star light (Charpinet+2011, Nature 480, 496; Silvotti +2014, A&A 570, 130). Given that only 7 single sdBs were observed by Kepler for enough time to detect tiny photometric variations of 20-50 ppm, we can assume that 2/7 of sdBs have Earth-size bodies in tight orbits at ~0.005 AU from the star. With a geometric transit probability of 0.2 (Rp<<RsdB, RsdB=0.001 AU), the prob. to see a transit is about 0.057, i.e. in average we need to observe ~18 sdB stars to see one transit. Similar numbers are obtained for more massive sdB companions detected through RVs (Geier+2012 ASPC 452, 153): 16% of their sample of 27 single-lined sdBs do show small RV variations compatible with massive substellar companions.
Here the geom. transit probability at 0.005 AU is ~0.28 (Rp=0.9 Rjup) so that, in average, 1 sdB out of ~22 should show transits and secondary eclipses.
The main goal of this proposal is to detect sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targetting in SC ~40 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. With typical transit durations of 15-40 min (at 6h<Porb<24h), SC is more adequate. The transit depth may vary between 25% (1 R_Jup) down to 0.2% (1 R_Earth). Thanks to the high number of transits in a ~80 days observation, K2 should be able to measure radii smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, PEPSI@LBT and ESPRESSO@VLT (both in or near commissioning) should be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.
The secondary goal of this proposal is to detect photometric variations due to reflection effects by a faint stellar companion, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting. Kepler gave already an important contribution to this field. K2 can increase by a factor 5 to 10 the statistics of well studied sdB+WD and sdB+dM systems. We point out that the secondary goal is compatible with LC data."

astrophysics, and solving this will have significant ramifications for our understanding of how other galaxies form and evolve. Success
will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution.
This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the
solar neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used
Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential
for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.
RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar
samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program
for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to
those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.
AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (on average ~5000 per campaign) to
probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to
make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys
structure and evolution from its stellar populations.
METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by
ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use
our seismic inferred stellar properties to stresstest state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."

Space data of these objects have led to a giant leap forward in our understanding of their structure and evolution through the discovery of new dynamical phenomena. Moreover, insight into these stars dynamics is of utmost importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. Throughout the K2 Mission we have been building a unique database of high precision RR Lyrae light curves from field to field, covering different parts of our Galaxy, and beyond. In this proposal we plan to study ~650 RR Lyrae stars in Fields 14-15-16. Our strategy assures that galactic structure studies and statistical analysis of pulsation properties (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko modulation, period doubling, low-dimensional chaos, non-radial modes) based on K2 data will be possible. Besides the ensemble studies, the analysis of individual stars will be equally interesting and important. For example, low-amplitude additional modes have been observed in all RR Lyrae subtypes, but their origins and occurrence rates are still largely unknown. We plan to complete our K2 Cepheid sample with a few Type II Cepheids in Field 15.  Targets. Approximately 650 RR Lyrae stars will be proposed (3-4 stars per field for short cadence observations) in the three fields, and 5 Type II Cepheids in Field 15. Field 14, towards the North Galactic Cap, contains 147 RR Lyrae stars, 11 RRd and 30 RRc stars among them. Field 15 has close to 400 RR Lyrae (5 RRd and 36 RRc) and 5 Type II Cepheids (2 BL Her, 2 W Vir and 1 RV Tau type). Finally, Field 16 offers 105 RR Lyrae targets (3 RRd, 22 RRc). Fields 14 & 16 do not have good Cepheid candidates. We will benefit from the overlap with previous fields (C5/C16 has 23, while C2/C15 has 2 common RR Lyrae targets); luckily both overlaps contain priority short-cadence RRc stars. Re-observation of these targets present a unique opportunity to assess our earlier findings that were based on previous K2 observations, and allows us to look at any longer term changes to our targets, such as Blazhko modulation, and the stability of additional modes.
 
Methods and community resources. Photometry of large-amplitude pulsators requires special treatment, and general-purpose pipelines may provide RR Lyrae light curves with sub-optimal quality. Therefore, we developed a specific algorithm (Extended Aperture Photometry, EAP) to deal with these difficulties. As a value-added community resource we publish a searchable database containing the light curves, frequency solutions and other parameters (Blazhko periods, additional modes, etc.) of the RR Lyrae and Cepheid stars observed by K2. Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. Metallicities will be derived from empirical relations calibrated with high-resolution spectra. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations.

Experience of team members. Our team consists of members of the Working Group#7 (RR Lyrae and Cepheids) of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, who have been working on Kepler data (also preparation and target selection) since the launch of the original mission. Our scientists are experts on data reduction, pixel photometry, light curve and time-frequency analysis, as well as theorists performing numerical hydrodynamical modeling. We routinely analyze Kepler and K2 data, and published 20 Kepler/K2 RR Lyrae and Cepheid papers in high-impact journals. The group has access to ground-based follow-up (multi-color photometric and spectroscopic) instruments in Taiwan, Korea, USA, Canada and Hungary."
GO15059,15,Anna,,Marciniak,Adam Mickiewicz University,am@amu.edu.pl,"Szabo, Robert; Szakats, Robert; Kiss, Csaba; Mueller, Thomas G",Physical studies of asteroids with Kepler,"As it has been demonstrated in some recent papers, the Kepler Space Telescope in the K2 mission is an excellent tool to observe asteroids and obtain accurate lightcurves even if the targets are relatively fast-moving main belt asteroids (Szabo et al., 2015, 2016a) or Jovian Trojans (Szabo et al., 2016b).   While in the case of trans-Neptunian bodies the lightcurve information is available for a limited sample only (see e.g. Kiss et al., 2015), the general spin characteristics of main belt asteroids are relatively well know due to their proximity and relatively short (~few years) orbital periods that allows us to observe these bodies at various spin axis aspect angles during their motion around the Sun. The sufficient orbital phase coverage also allows us to apply lightcurve inversion techniques to obtain detailed shape models for these targets (Kaasalainen et al., 2002).  In this proposal our goal is to obtain lightcurves of slowly rotating asteroids with low amplitudes, to decrease the strong selection effects in spin and shape studies of asteroids. Currently spin and shape models are mainly available for targets with relatively short rotation periods and substantial elongations of their shapes that results in a biased sample of asteroids with known physical properties (Marciniak et al. 2015). Consequently, our knowledge on spin vs. diameter, the internal cohesion and strength or the non-gravitational effects are biased, too. Data from asteroids observed in the K2 mission can substantially increase the data pool for asteroids omitted in previous studies, enabling continuous observations of targets with periods of the order of days.  We also investigate small asteroids with spin axes close to the ecliptic plane. Some studies suggest their non-existence due to non-gravitational YORP effect (Durech et al. 2016). However, such lack can be a selection effect, because such targets often display very small amplitudes when viewed pole-on. Kepler/K2 data will allow us to decide whether the low amplitude of these targets are due to close to pole-on configurations.   We propose to observe a set of main belt asteroids for which additional high-quality lightcurve data obtained with K2 would enable us to obtain spin and shape models for the first time. Some of the targets, (203) Pompeja, (566) Stereoskopia and (308) Polyxo have rotation periods close to 12h or 24h and have small, <0.1 mag lightcurve amplitudes. These targets are difficult to observe from ground due to daily gaps and aliases, and would require coordinated observations from many observing sites, typically flawed by weather conditions. The Kepler Space Telescope is able to perform these observations alone. (525) Adelaide is a target with highly inclined spin axis and strongly variable amplitudes, sometimes being as low as 0.02 mag. Obtaining full, composite lightcurve of this P=19.967 h target would be very difficult from the ground, as the period exceeds the length of the average observing night. In practice, only continuous data from a space-based observatory can provide meaningful data for this target. (437) Rhodia is a very slow rotator with a period of ~56 hours, and variable, usually very low amplitudes. A sufficiently long, continuous measurement of this target would allow us to determine the orientation of its (likely) multiple spin axes.   All our 14 targets will spend enough time on silicon (typically ~5 days) that a sufficient light curve coverage can be guaranteed.  References: - Durech et al., 2016, A&A, 587, A48

The spacecraft was launched on December 3, 2014, it will arrive to the asteroid in 2018, perform a survey, land and obtain surface material, then depart in December 2019, and return to the Earth in December 2020.

Many support observations were taken during the last years to characterise Ryugu, in preparation for the mission: The object was found to have a 7.6h (0.317d) rotation period (Abe et al. 2008; Moskovitz et al. 2013; Kim et al. 2013) and an absolute magnitude of about 19.2, however, the low amplitude of the lightcurve and the poor quality of the available photometry made it difficult to determine rotation period and spin-axis orientation and the object's shape. Pinilla-Alonso et al. (2013) obtained a low-resolution near-IR spectrum and confirmed the primitive nature of this Cg-type object. Two independent studies (Lazzaro et al. 2013; Moskovitz et al. 2013) found featureless spectra with very little variation, indicating a nearly homogeneous surface. Ishiguro et al. (2014) derived H-G from V-band observations covering a very wide phase angle range. There are many thermal infrared observations available (AKARI-IRC, Subaru-COMICS, Spitzer-IRS, Herschel-PACS, Spitzer-IRAC with a sequence of point-and-shoot measurements and also 2-band lightcurves at two different epochs), and radiometric studies have been performed by different groups (Hasegawa et al. 2008; Campins et al. 2009; Mueller et al. 2011; Yu et al. 2014), with different sizes, thermal properties, object shape and spin properties obtained. As the object is almost spherical, the determination of its spin pole is very difficult and the derived physical and thermal properties depend strongly on assumptions of the spin axis orientation. Recently, Mueller et al. (2016) combined all thermal data with all available visual lightcurves to solve for shape, rotational properties, size, albedo, and thermal properties, by applying different techniques, but despite the large set of observations, there are still different spin-axis orientations for Ryugu possible and each of these solutions is coming with a different set of physical and thermal properties.  In order to settle the ambiguities for Ryugu, we propose to take high-quality lightcurve observations with Kepler K2 in Field 15 in Sep/Oct 2017. Ryugu will have an apparent visual magnitude between 20.7 and 21.2 (similar to some Trojans presented in Szabo et al. 2016) and it will be available in that field for more than 15 days. 
The K2 observations will cover more than 40 full rotation periods and provide lightcurve information with unprecedented accuracy. In combination with available lightcurves, photometric measurements, and the wealth of thermal data, the K2 data will allow us: (i) to determine the object's rotation period with high accuracy; (ii) to narrow down the range for Ryugu's spin-axis orientation; (iii) to improve the object's shape solution; (iv) to re-analyse all thermal measurements with the best shape/spin solution to determine the object's size, albedo, and thermal properties with unprecedented accuracy. The full rotational, physical, thermal and surface characterisation will then be used as baseline for mission operations in 2018/2019 during the encounter phase. Ryugu is also considered as a benchmark target for the validation of radiometric and light curve inversion techniques, applicable to many near-Earth objects.

Indeed, K2 observed the first such example in Campaign 1: WD1145+017 (Vanderburg et al. 2015), which we have followed-up on with high resolution spectroscopy (Redfield et al. 2016). Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013). The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations. The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]). Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015). I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns).

Methodology: Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total. The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits. The first planets detected were around a compact object, a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992). Additionally, N-body simulations of planetary systems through stellar evolution indicate it is possible to return significant mass objects back very close to the white dwarf (Veras & Gaensicke 2015), so it is likely for white dwarfs to host planets. Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign. Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence. Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground. While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation. However, a followup campaign on known targets is quite straightforward. At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope. However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."

A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets. It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come. I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 pc. A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons. This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes. This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques. Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars. While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges. A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be 200-300 stars (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars). In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored. The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets.

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability. An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003). One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium. This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint. Long cadence observations would be appropriate.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found. These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."

These parts (the bulge, thick disk, thin disk, halo) feature distinct stellar populations, and understanding the properties of those populations is an ongoing effort. Studying these properties relies on reliable fundamental parameters of stars: their masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities. Eclipsing binary stars lend themselves naturally to this task, since their favorable geometrical orientation and basic laws of gravity enable us to determine fundamental parameters to a ~1% accuracy. We scoured the published catalogs and proprietary KELT and SuperWASP data for all eclipsing binary stars in K2 C14, C15 and C16 fields. We propose to observe these stars and, along with other serendipitous discoveries of binarity in the fields, build a stellar population model based on the fundamental parameters derived from K2 data and follow-up multi-color photometry and spectroscopy. Studying the intrinsic differences in stellar populations across K2 fields will allow us to infer the dependence on galactic latitude and contribute to our understanding of stellar population distribution in our Galaxy."

GO15067,15,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,brice.demory@csh.unibe.ch,,Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types from M0 to L8, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such exoplanet has been discovered for the first time earlier this year. As of today, K2 represents an unprecedented opportunity to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0 through 13 observations.  SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.  High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).  RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.  METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 14, 15 and 16, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series (Demory et al. 2016). The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on existing K2 data and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program.  EXPECTED YIELD. We have assembled a list of 139 M6 to L3 objects for campaigns 13 to 16. Several targets have been observed in previous campaigns and have been removed for the target list to avoid duplication.

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."
GO15068,15,Adam,Gabriel,Jensen,University of Nebraska-Kearney,JensenAG@unk.edu,"Redfield, Seth; Cauley, Paul Wilson; Endl, Michael",Searching for (More) Extended Exoplanetary Atmospheres Around Active Stars,"A key question in studying any planetary atmosphere is what happens at the boundary between the atmosphere and interplanetary space. This unbound, outermost layer of an atmosphere is called its exosphere. Several observations of extended atmospheres have been made (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Schlawin et al. 2010; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010, 2012; Fossati et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2012; Cauley et al. 2015, 2016) in hydrogen (both ground-state and excited) and various metals.  Our team detected excited, n=2 hydrogen (through hydrogen alpha absorption) in the exosphere of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012), the first such detection in an exoplanet's atmosphere. Follow-up observations (Cauley et al. 2015, 2016) confirmed this result by detecting exospheric absorption in hydrogen alpha, hydrogen beta, and hydrogen gamma, and also observed a significant pre-transit signal in these lines. The pre-transit signal is variable between the two observation sets and the physical interpretation is not clear. Jensen et al. (2012) hypothesized that the excited hydrogen in the exosphere (the transit signal) may be correlated with chromospheric activity, as HD 189733b, the only planet in that paper's sample of four planets to show H-alpha absorption, was also the most chromospherically active in the sample (as measured by S_HK and log [R'_HK] indices).  In Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 3, we proposed to search for planets around stars which are candidates for chromospheric activity in the Kepler 8 and 10 fields. We found dozens of suitable targets based on the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Survey's catalogue of chromospherically active stars (Zerjal et al. 2013).  A similar proposal in Cycle 4 was not selected for funding but a small subset of our targets will be observed.  We now propose to do the same for Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 5 for the Kepler Campaign 14, 15, and 16 fields. Because Field 15 is in the southern celestial hemisphere, it will have the most targets provided by the RAVE survey.  Adding targets from these fields will greatly improve the chance of success of the accepted Cycle 3 proposal at minimal cost of targets to the K2 mission (data from Field 8, which had a much smaller number of targets than Field 10, again due to the location of the fields and our reliance on the RAVE database, has been downloaded and is being analyzed; data for Field 10 and Cycle 4 targets have not yet been released).

Looking for planets around active stars with radial velocity methods is often disfavored because the stellar noise limits RV precision. However, this makes the transit method the more important way to detect planets in these cases. Furthermore, if any of these stars do have a transiting planet, they will be excellent potential candidates for follow-up spectroscopy with the large ground-based telescopes (Keck I, HobbyEberly Telescope) that our team has used in the past to detect exospheric absorption. The goal of follow-up spectroscopic observations would be to search for excited hydrogen absorption from an exosphere, including possible pre-transit signals. As a secondary science product, many of these active stars will have light curves worth studying on their own for stellar astrophysics purposes."

These stars have not yet been further observed for confirmation, but we are deploying efforts to do so.  It is likely that most of these targets are false alarms, as is common for ground-based transit surveys, but given the initial data from KELT, each of them are more likely to be transit hosts than randomly selected bright dwarf stars in the K2 fields.  The transit signatures in the light curves for these targets should be easily measurable by K2."

Scientific Justification 
We request K2 monitoring of unidentified and known X-ray sources in Campaigns 14 through 16, compiled from a variety of sources
 including the Chandra Source Catalog and the Million Quasar Catalog, to probe accretion onto compact objects at a variety of mass
 and time scales. Our KSwAGS survey found 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., 2015). Approximately
 half were active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various types (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring
 M-stars). A Kepler GO survey (PI: Still) of Chandra point sources resulted in a similar distribution of stars to active galaxies. High
 precision optical follow-up is scientifically useful for all sources; the AGN allow for a study of variability characteristics as a function
 of SMBH mass (Smith et al., 2015) and the stars allow for the study of a variety of rapid rotators and chromospheric activity (Howell
 et al., 2016). We received time for K2 to monitor KSwAGS sources in Fields 4,8 and 11-13. This proposal has identical scientific
 goals and will continue the K2 optical monitoring of X-ray sources, but with target selection criteria that relies on archival X-ray
 observations only and not on new Swift pointings. 
Previous AGN in the original Kepler field were selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012).
 These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 10^8 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum
 is dominated by starlight rather than AGN light (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2012). Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-
MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be
 constrained by a ~80-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks.
 This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is
 expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or
 other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk). This further monitoring will critically
 enhance the sample numbers of K2-monitored AGN discovered using a relatively unbiased selection method. We expect on the order of
 50-100 targets in each Field depending on galactic latitude.  Methodology and Relevance to NASA Astrophysics Science Goals 
We aim to use K2s impressive photometric precision to detect characteristic variability timescales using Fourier analysis. These
 timescales are the only possible direct observables of AGN accretion physics, which remains an important astrophysical mystery and
 directly addresses NASA Astrophysics goal to ""[d]iscover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search
 for life on planets around other stars."".  Additionally, these X-ray selected targets will fill in the phase-space of black hole mass and
 accretion rate, complementing our work in the original Kepler field."

We are especially targeting binaries and potential binaries.  Their spin states preserve observable and interpretable signatures of their formation circumstances.  They are also subject to subsequent dynamical evolution, notably tidal despinning, offering opportunities to learn about those processes as well.  Disentangling these influences calls for a large sample of well-characterized systems to enable statistical comparison of ensemble properties across the various sub-populations.  This proposal contributes toward the goal of assembling that sample.  We will observe all known transneptunian binary systems on silicon during C14-C16, as well as a number of potential binaries.  K2s ability to observe continuously is key to teasing apart the rotational modulations of unresolved multi-body systems if they are different, or being able to determine that they are not, in cases where they have become tidally locked like Pluto and Charon.

We have assembled a team with all necessary expertise to fully capitalize on the data.  We have experience working with K2 data and have a proven processing pipeline.  We have a strong track record in both observational and theoretical Kuiper belt studies, including analysis of photometric lightcurve data, orbit determination, and dynamical modeling.

This project would be impractical from the ground.  The targets are faint, and weeks or even months of observing time would be needed to confidently extract the weak modulation from a fainter secondary not tidally locked to its primary.  K2 is ideally suited for this work.  Long cadence exposures provide adequate temporal resolution.

One of NASA's key strategic goals in planetary science is advancing knowledge of the origin and history of the Solar System.  This proposal is aimed squarely at that goal, specifically for the transneptunian region where our targets formed.  We aim to shed light on how the Sun's inventory of planets and minor bodies originated and subsequently evolved to its current dynamical configuration and compositional state.  Observations of the Cold Classical sub-population of transneptunian objects also provide valuable context for NASA's upcoming flyby and detailed study of one such object, 2014 MU69, along with the more distant observations of a larger sample of them that New Horizons is doing as it cruises through that region of the Kuiper belt."
GO15074,15,Niall,R,Deacon,University of Hertfordshire,nialldeacon@hotmail.com,"Mann, Andrew Withycombe; Kraus, Adam L",The effect of wide binaries on planet occurrence - K2 Cycle 5,"We plan to observe a sample of wide binaries spread across the K2 fields to constrain the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence and to provide benchmark systems for gyrochronology.

 
Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence.} Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013).  In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star. Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity.Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars.

 
 
Science Goal 2: Provide benchmark gyrochronology systems. Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components.

 
 
By including wide binary components as Kepler targets, we will produce a valuable legacy product to test and recalibrate gyrochronology relations allowing the ages of field stars to be better constrained.

 
Target Selection. We will use the proper motion catalogue produced by Kraus et al. (2014) based on the methods of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007) including proper motions, estimated spectral types and distance moduli from SED fitting. We will select objects with significant (>5sigma) proper motions above 30mas/yr. From these we will select pairs of widely separated objects with common proper motion and distance.  To remove contamination due to coincident pairings of unrelated field stars, we will plot a histogram similar to the one we constructed for field 6 of pair separation. From this we will select pairs which lie in the region dominated by true physical pairs."

Paul",Searching for Planets around Bright Binary ``Twin_x005F_x005F_x005F_x005F Stars with K2,"A new, growing body of work aims to revisit how planet formation may alter host star composition by examining differences between stars that do/do not host planets. Wide binary stars provide an ideal laboratory for investigating the effects of planet formation on stellar composition. Assuming the stars formed in the same environment/from the same material, any differences in composition between the binary components could be related to planet formation.  Furthermore, studying ``twin'' stars (_x005F_x005FTeff d 100 K, _x005F_x005Flog g d 0.1 dex, _x005F_x005F[Fe/H] d 0.03 dex) allows for very precise relative abundance measurements, as systematic uncertainties that usually dominate such analyses are so similar that they essentially cancel out. The remaining observational noise can then be pushed down with very high S/N, high-resolution spectra. I have started an observational program targeting known exoplanet host star binary systems, and have led three studies of twin planet hosting stars, including in my most recent paper the detection of three new long period giant planets via radial velocity observations. Studying twin star abundance differences may prove to be the most useful for constraining the effects of planet formation on stars, but we need more data to understand their significance; only eight twin binary host star systems are currently known.  Here I propose to observe HD 134439 and HD 134440 in K2 Campaign 15 to search for transiting planets in this well-characterized, bright twin binary system. Even one more twin binary planet hosting system would be a significant addition to the current sample. My collaborators have RV observations of these stars going back 20 years, and although the data do not yet allow for firm planet detection, they suggest a planet with a ~3d period around HD 134440. Given this suggested period and minimum mass, and the estimated radius of the star, the transit probability of such a planet is between ~10% and 20%. If transiting planets are found around either star in this system, we already have RV data to constrain the planet masses. We also already have high-resolution spectra of both stars, so I can perform a high precision abundance analysis to determine if the stars show different chemical abundances and examine whether this could be due to planet formation. While these stars abundances have been measured in the past, no such high precision, differential study has been conducted, which is necessary to tease out the very small compositional differences that could be due to (different types of) planet formation.

The HD 134439/40 system is intriguing for additional reasons, besides being a bright twin binary. First, these stars are significantly metal-poor ([Fe/H]~1.5), yet also low in ±-elements like Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, unlike many metal-poor halo stars. This abundance pattern, combined with their UVW motions, suggest an extra-Galactic origin for this common proper-motion pair, the low-± ratios being consistent in particular with formation in a low/irregular star formation rate environment. Second, the low volatile elemental abundances (e.g., C, N, O) versus refractory element abundances (e.g., Ti, Fe, Mg) are consistent with claims of chemical pollution of the stellar atmosphere via planetesimal/refractory accretion. Third, lithium is enhanced in HD 134439 but undetected in HD 134440; this has also been suggested as a signature of planets, via increased mixing in the star from rotational braking and/or more mixing from tidal forces. Thus, (1) promising signs of planet formation have already been detected in HD 134439/40, and (2) if planets were detected around either star, it would be the most metal-poor planetary system ever discovered (and likely has an extra-Galactic origin)."

We propose a Large K2 Program to monitor on the order of 10,000 bright galaxies in each of Campaign C14, C15, and C16, which should yield in total more than 15 great light curves (LCs) of supernovae. In Kepler GO programs, we have identified to date 3 SN Ia (Olling et al. 2015), 2 SN IIP (Garnavich et al. 2016; Tucker et al., submitted), and 1 SN IIn/Ia-csm (Garnavich et al., in prep.). We also found that ~4% of our galaxies display AGN activity with variability at >0.001% level (Shaya et al 2015). In K2 Campaign C3, C5, C6, C8, and C10 we identified more than 15 SNe, three of which we spectroscopically classified. Analysis of the K2 data is ongoing.  With our program, we plan to a) determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe using features in the early breakout (t < 4 days) LCs; b) explore the explosion physics of SN, especially SN Ia, using subtle features during their rise (t < 20 days); c) improve the calibration of SN Ia as standard candles for measuring distances, Ho, and dark energy using K2 LCs of unprecedented detail; and d) add significant knowledge to the virtually unexplored very low-Eddington regime of AGN.  There is an ongoing controversy over the basic physics of one of the key tools in cosmology, the SN Ia standard candle. Do SNe Ia gradually reach critical mass via accretion from a companion star or does it merge with another WD? If a white dwarf had been accreting mass from a companion star, as the ejecta reaches the companion a shock would form with observable optical emission (Kasen 2010). The emission would be short and strongest from certain viewing angles, requiring rapid cadence for several SNe before definitive conclusions can be reached. For the 3 SN Ia discovered by Kepler monitoring of ~500 galaxies (Olling et al. 2015), no signatures of a companion were found and tight constraints were placed. With a larger sample, we can determine the statistics for the two possible channels that trigger SN Ia. Meanwhile, features due to the different explosion physics (detonation, deflagration, inwards-moving diffusion waves, etc) of Ia and core collapse SNe will also be revealed. K2 will allow for the first time to test models more complicated than simple ""expanding fireballs.""  We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe the entire field every other day using SkyMapper, ATLAS and DECam. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify discovered transients using Lick, Gemini, and Keck. In Campaign C5 and C6, we successfully identified 4 SNe with DECam observations, of which we classified 2 with Gemini spectra as SN Ia. These data, coupled with high precision 30 minute K2 data will have enormous legacy value.  Methods: 
We have developed and proven a highly successful detrending method that simultaneously solves for the sawtooth pattern caused by pointing motion and for the coefficients of vectors from principal component analysis of targets on the same channel. This iterative technique permits us to define aperture sizes better suited to this problem and to make excellent corrections for sensitivity variations on all time scales. To properly correct SN light curves, the technique is applied to the quiet time before the event and then extrapolated to the end of the campaign.  References:

These cores are at the centers of all horizontal branch stars so understanding them has impact across much of astronomy. Our understanding comes from applying seismic constraints from their pulsations to stellar models which contain appropriate physics. Only Kepler (K1) and K2 observations have proven sufficient to interpret their pulsations (even TESS will not contribute). So campaigns 14 to 16 are our last chance to accumulate observational data. Pulsating horizontal branch cores are sdBV stars. K1 discovered 19 and K2 (to C8) has discovered 18 and observed 2 known sdBV stars. Through several years experience, we have made great progress, with several analyses ongoing. We have learned to robustly assign pulsation modes using asymptotic period spacings, rotationally split multiplets, and the value of the Ledoux constant. These supply extremely strong constraints to structural models, which prior to K1 were under-constrained, but now demonstrate contradictions between observation and theory. This implies that the models require new physics, especially regarding the physics of diffusion and tides, and will lead to a better understanding of stellar structure.
 We anticipated degeneracies between core mass, envelope mass, and evolution, requiring multiple stars to overcome. From K1, and continuing with K2, we have found that core masses in sdBV stars have a narrow range. We have uncovered new features including: stars with differential and others with uniform rotation; stars with stable pulsations and others with stochastic properties; frequency multiplets which we associate with stellar rotation that are constant, converging, or diverging; pulsations in only pressure (surface) modes, only gravity (core-sensing) modes, and both (hybrids); varying degrees of mode trapping, which is a consequence of  internal stratification; and rotation rates which are long, sub-synchronous when in binaries, yet we are discovering groupings, likely related to mass loss/exchange mechanisms.To discriminate the causes of these various features will require substantial modelling efforts, but those can only proceed with observational constraints. As such, we still urgently need K2 observations of sdBV stars covering the full range of pulsation properties, especially in the pressure-mode domain, which is very sparsely populated by K1+K2 observations.
 Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterisation, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have already published over 20 papers from K1 and five from K2.
 We propose to observe about 5-8 stars per campaign, most of which are so far unobserved for pulsations. We only select the most promising targets, both in terms of potential pulsation and binary properties. Processes we can probe include radiative and gravitational diffusion; binary interaction, mass and
angular momentum exchange; post-helium flash core structure; and helium fusion cross-sections via evolution.
 We also include students in our work. Many of our papers include undergraduate students as significant contributors. Students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret K2 data for pulsations and binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterisation studies, providing them with a broad range of training. Graduate students at European partner institutions will be working with us; processing and interpreting pulsations, as well as developing new physics for sdB star models as part of their thesis work. Only K2 provides sufficient accuracy, duty cycle, and duration necessary to fully exploit sdB pulsations as a probe of stellar astrophysics."
GO15081,15,Joyce,Ann,Guzik,Los Alamos National Laboratory,joy@lanl.gov,"Jackiewicz, Jason; Gaulme, Patrick",Variability of Stellar Analogs to F3 V Stars theta Cyg and KIC 8462852,"We propose to observe in short cadence several bright main-sequence stars of mid-F spectral type in each of K2 Campaigns 14, 15, and 16.  theta Cyg was the brightest star observed by the original Kepler mission (visual magnitude 4.5), and was observed in short cadence using a custom mask during Quarters 8 and 12-17 (Guzik et al. 2016, ApJ 831, 17 ).  With effective temperature 6697 ± 78 K (spectroscopy), mass 1.39 solar masses (asteroseismology) and radius 1.49 solar radii (interferometry), theta Cyg was expected from pulsation models to show gamma Doradus-type g-mode pulsations with periods of order one day, but no g modes were detected.  However, theta Cyg does exhibit stochastically excited solar-like oscillations with frequency of maximum amplitude 1829 µHz that were used for asteroseismic modeling.

KIC 8462852 (a.k.a. Tabby's star) was observed by Kepler for 16 quarters, however, only in long cadence.  Spectroscopic observations place this star at effective temperature 6750 ± 120 K, with an estimated mass 1.43 solar masses and radius 1.58 solar radii (Boyajian et al. 2016, MNRAS 457, 3988).   KIC 8462852 shows a prominent small-amplitude period of 0.88 day that is probably related to rotation, as well as a longer period (10-20 day) brightness variation.  This star notably shows irregular mysterious flux decreases of up to 20 percent lasting 5 to 80 days, as well as a slow brightness decrease of about a percent throughout the Kepler mission. The causes of these unusual brightness changes are under investigation(Boyajian et al. 2016; Montet and Simon 2016, ApJL 830, L39; Wright and Sigurdssen 2016, ApJL, 829, L3).  Although external causes such as eclipses by comet swarms are a leading explanation, intrinsic stellar brightness variations by an unknown mechanism have not been entirely ruled out.  An asteroseismic analysis of KIC 87462852 cannot be carried out (yet) because of the lack of short-cadence observations that may have revealed solar-like oscillations such as those found in theta Cyg.

We expect that short-cadence K2 observations of relatively bright mid-F main-sequence stars will provide additional pulsating targets for detailed asteroseismic modeling.  Finding stars that exhibit both solar-like observations and gamma Dor g-mode or even delta Sct-like p-mode oscillations would provide constraints on stellar properties, age, and pulsation driving mechanisms.  There may exist analogs of theta Cyg or KIC 8462852 in the Kepler and K2 data archives observed in short cadence, although the Kepler targets are likely to be less bright or have shorter time-series observations than theta Cyg or KIC 8462852.  Solar-like oscillations were first characterized with a partial quarter of Kepler data for theta Cyg, and they have also been measured in short-cadence K2 data (e.g., Lund et al. 2016, MNRAS 463, 200).  The generally higher-amplitude gamma Dor and delta Sct pulsations should be detectable, if they exist.  Perhaps asteroseismic modeling of additional F3 V spectral-type stars will provide clues to the strange photometric variations of KIC 8462852, or at least help to rule out intrinsic brightness variations.  It is even possible that stars with similar anomalous brightness variations may be discovered.  Further observations of such stars would help to define and explain the transition region between solar-like and gamma Doradus pulsators on the main sequence.

Our small-proposal budget request is $20 K for the PI to execute the project.  The possibility exists to leverage support via the New Mexico Consortium for a student shared between the PI institution and New Mexico State University."

Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system, colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk, & studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength limiting models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies.  Lightcurves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations and their origins. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. These 2 populations are in resonances with Jupiter & collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations . Results from the WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojans & ~40% of Hildas are either extremely elongated objects or binaries, however preliminary results from our Kepler GO2-GO3 suggest a higher binary fraction within the Trojans and lower within the Hildas.  Ground based surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability study due to large amounts of observing time required (approximately 4 to 5 nights per object on a 2-m class telescope) & nightly aliasing effects on lightcurves. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform and the correspondence between the C14 & C16 fields and the L5 Trojan cloud.

The science objectives of this program are as follows: 
Objective 1: Measure the lightcurve amplitude for ~ 90 Hildas and Trojans for comparison with the Scattered Kuiper Belt population 
Objective 2: Determine binary fraction of Hildas and Trojans via lightcurve transits and compare to results from the Kuiper Belt & WISE  Methodology: We have identified 89 objects for study in the Hilda and Trojan asteroids to be studied with Kepler in C14-16 with magnitudes of m_V < 21. Due to the overlap between the Campaign 14 field and the L5 Trojan cloud, our request for data represents 56 objects Campaign 14 (30 Hildas, 26 Trojans), 25 objects in Campaign 15 ( 21 Hildas and 4 Trojans) & 8 L4 Trojans in Campaign 16. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 24 days. Due to the motion of these targets, the Kepler Science Center assesses solar system program as containing more targets than proposed number of objects, (In C11, our program with 70 solar system targets was assessed 17118 Kepler target masks), thus THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity to address objectives 1&2.  Relevance to K2: 
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 14-16 to determine if these objects originated in the Kuiper Belt and later migrated and are amenable to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission and defined observing fields."

This outgassing however presents challenges to characterizing comet nuclei in terms of surface color and rotational period which are utilized to characterize their asteroid siblings. At periods wherein comets appear the brightest, their flux is dominated by gas and dust in the coma, leaving the best observational circumstances for cometary nuclei when these objects are at distances > ~3 AU beyond which sublimation of water ice does not drive the cometary coma.  Lightcurves have been utilized to estimate the limits bulk density and approximate shapes and/or axial ratios of cometary nuclei for only a small handful of the known comet population.  In many cases rotational periods of comets are poorly constrained due to incomplete ground based telescopic data over the fitted period. This results in both errors in estimates of the axial ratios and the rotational periods for the observed comet nuclei.  We propose to utilize K2 to obtain lightcurves for 11 comets in GO-5 to :
* Determine the rotational periods and amplitudes for a sample of comets at heliocentric distances > 3 AU which will be compared to other bodies such as Trojan and Hilda asteroids, as well as Kuiper Belt Objects
* Compare lightcurve periods to those published in the literature for a subsample of short period comets to determine if the rotational period of these cometary nuclei has been altered by outgassing activity Methodology:
We have identified 11 comets to be studied by Kepler in Campaigns 14-16 with magnitudes of m_V < 21. The single observation photometric uncertainty for objects of 21st magnitude observed with the 30 minute cadence of K2 is 0.15 magnitudes, sufficient to identify objects with axis ratios >= 1.15. Two comets within our sample have published rotational periods and have undergone an additional perihelion passage, allowing us to determine if the rotational period has been modified.

Relevance to K2: 
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 14-16 to determine if these objects have lightcurve periods and amplitudes common to specific asteroid populations consistent with a common origin in the early solar system. Our sample is only comprised of objects within the K2 fields, and thus does not require any modifications from the reported operational characteristics of the spacecraft during these campaigns."

eclipsing binaries that consist of massive B-type stars, 
yet are found far from the disk of the Galaxy.   
The best explanation may involve ejection from a 
birthplace in the Galactic plane through dynamical 
interactions with other stars or through a supernova 
explosion of a prior companion.  However, in the case of 
IT Lib, its current position and velocity imply that 
ejection occurred some 33 million years ago, longer than 
the estimated main-sequence lifetime of the primary of 
22 million years. We need to re-assess the masses and 
other properties of the binary in order to try to 
resolve this inconsistency.   IT Lib will be within the Kepler K2 field of view during 
Campaign 15, and this offers us a remarkable opportunity to 
obtain an extremely high quality light curve.  Furthermore, 
the residuals from the binary light curve will also 
demonstrate whether either star is a pulsator, which would 
enable asteroseismology studies of the interiors. 
Here we propose to include IT Lib in the C15 program and to 
obtain complementary high resolution spectroscopy in order to 
perform a complete analysis of the physical and chemical 
properties of the stellar components of the binary.  These 
will be compared to models to test whether the timescales of

Many sdBs are known to have close companions with periods ranging from 0.05 to 10 days, and must have evolved through the common-envelope-ejection (CEE) process. The closest systems are quite easy to study from the ground, but Kepler observations have opened the door for precise studies of the population of systems with periods between 0.5 and and 10 days.  Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission. The excellent Kepler light curves show photometric signals from Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal deformations and mutual irradiation effects. Long-cadence K2 observations presents us with an unique opportunity to accumulate a larger sample of post-common envelope sdB binaries that can shed light on the statistics of the CEE process, and thereby constrain the long sought after efficiency parameters that govern the common envelope stage of evolution. In the process we hope to find new particularly interesting binary systems, such as the eclipsing cases and those with extraordinary masses that could be progenitors of type-Ia supernovae."
GO15090,15,Thomas,,Kupfer,Caltech,tkupfer@caltech.edu,"Groot, Paul J; Prince, Thomas A; Bellm, Eric C",The ultracompact AMCVn type binary HP Lib,"AMCVn systems are rare, ultracompact binaries consisting of a white  dwarf primary and a (semi-)degenerate secondary whose study is critical to our understanding of such diverse areas as binary evolution, supernova Ia progenitors and common envelope (CE) evolution. AMCVn systems are highly evolved and unique systems, having undergone two CE phases and a direct impact phase - something that is still poorly understood. Only 51 AMCVn systems are known. They show orbital periods in a range of 5.4 - 65 min. Spectroscopically they are characterized by a lack of hydrogen and an enhancement of  helium, which is an indicator of the advanced evolutionary state of the  systems. As these systems evolve from a short orbital period, their  mass transfer rate decreases by several orders of magnitude as the orbit widens and the orbital period increases. As ultracompact binaries, they are one of the strongest and most abundant sources of gravitational wave radiation in the eLISA regime and will be verification binaries after launch.

So far only SDSS J1908, a 18min AMCVn type binary, has been observed in fast-cadence mode with Kepler and studied in detail by the PI of this proposal. A Fourier analysis of the Kepler data revealed a large number of frequencies above the noise level where the majority shows a large variability in frequency and amplitude possibly caused by the tidal interaction between the accretion disc and the companion.  HP Lib has a similar orbital period as SDSS J1908. Here we request fast-cadence Kepler K2 observations of HP Lib (which falls on chip in campaign 15) to study accretion disc variability with high precision and long baseline provided by K2 and search for a change in the orbital period which is expected to increase."
GO15092,15,Kathleen,E,Kraemer,Boston College,kathleen.kraemer@bc.edu,"Sloan, Gregory C",K2 Observations of Evolved Stars in Elemental Stellar Systems,"We propose to use K2 to observe evolved stars in a primitive stellar system: NGC 5897, a metal-poor globular cluster in the Galactic halo that will be in Field 15. Previous work with Kepler has demonstrated  asteroseismology as an important tool for investigating stellar evolution (e.g., Chaplin & Miglio 2013).  We will apply these methods to stars that have evolved past the main sequence, to red giant stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and known variable stars in NGC 5897.  During the AGB phase of stellar evolution, in particular, a star sheds most of its mass, driven by long-period pulsations.  While the broad outline is understood, the details of the processes remain murky.  Results from Kepler and CoRoT for AGB stars suggest that their long periods (100's of days) may be tied to the very short periods (i.e., ~seconds and minutes) to which K2 is sensitive (e.g., Mosser et al. 2013).  However, those were field stars, where many important stellar parameters are unknown.  For a globular cluster, in contrast, the distance, metallicity, age, etc. are typically known.  Thus, we can investigate our targets with few assumptions needed to constrain the asteroseismology models.  At [Fe/H] ~ -2.0, NGC 5897 has a lower metallicity than the two globular clusters previously targeted with K2. Thus, it will provide an important connection to metal-poor systems in the high red-shift Universe. The high-frequency oscillations detectable only with K2 can help determine stellar parameters such as surface gravity, mass, radius, which are otherwise hard to deduce for evolved stars.  We will investigate how these properties change during the campaign, i.e., how their derived characteristics change as a function of phase of the longer pulsation periods of the giant branch stars.  NGC 5897 also contains several RR Lyrae variables, evolved stars which have much shorter periods. These kinds of evolved stars provide an important rung in the distance ladder, so understanding how their properties depend on metallicity is vital. We will combine these observations with photometric and spectroscopic data from our on-going project to study evolved stars in these kinds of stellar systems."

These families include main belt asteroids (Szabo, R. et al., 2016), Trojans of Jupiter (Szabo, Gy. et al.), trans-Neptunian objects (Pal et al. 2015, 2016, AJ) as well as irregular satellites of giant planets (Kiss et al. 2016, Pal et al. 2016, DPS). The value and information extracted from these light curves can be incorporated as it is own in order to determine the rotation period and derive shape characteristics as well as these measurements can be combined with other types of data, mainly with the quantification of the thermal infrared emission (Muller et al. 2009). Beyond the determination these basic physical properties, we can have hints about the presence of a moon (Marton, Kiss & Muller, 2016), we can constrain the history and relation of natural satellites and trans-Neptunian objects (Pal et al. 2016, DPS) or can ask whether there is any object which spins faster than Haumea (Rabinowitz et al., 2006).

Throughout the campaigns of 14, 15 and 16, 10+25+16 trans-Neptunian objects and Centaurs fall on silicon. One of these, 2001 YH140 has already been observed by K2 (during Campaign 5). We note that more than the half of these objects (8+13+8, in total) are recent discoveries by Pan-STARRS.

Here we propose to observe 5+11+9 trans-Neptunian objects and a Quasi-Hilda comet candidate throughout K2 campaigns of 14, 15 and 16. From this set, two objects have thermal emission data. Similarly to our former proposals, we set up the target priorities according to the apparent brightness, the diversity of dynamical classes and the presence of far-infrared thermal measurements. This sample of ours include many recent Pan-STARRS discoveries for which further astrometric measurements are also valuable. Due to the large number of this total sample of relevant objects (including TNOs and Centaurs), we propose only the objects which are sufficiently bright (brighter than 22.5) and have a sufficiently long arch (i.e. longer than 30 days) on a single CCD output. However, we note that even fainter ones and objects which shorter arcs can well be measured using K2 long cadence data (see e.g. Pal et al. 2015).

Classical Be stars are rapid rotators of spectral type B and luminosity class V-III which have an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk. The disk often exhibits Balmer emission lines and an infrared excess fed by discrete mass loss events called outbursts. In spite of their high V sin i, rapid rotation alone cannot explain  the ejection episodes as most Be stars do not rotate at their critical rotation rates. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations have been analyzed to demonstrate short-term variations are rather common among early-type Be stars. The observed line profile variability (LPV) is characterized by moving bumps traveling from blue to red across the line profile on timescales ranging from minutes to a few days. Non-radial pulsations (NRP) have been proposed as an explanation of the LPV observed in hot stars. NRP produce LPV thanks to the combination of the Doppler displacement of stellar surface elements with their associated temperature variations due to the compression/expansion caused by the passage of waves through the photosphere. NRP could be the additional mechanism required for a rapidly rotating B star to become a Be star, that is to trigger the Be phenomenon by means of mass ejection(Rivinius et al. 1998).   Huat et al. (2009) found for the Be HD 49330 from CoRoT and ground-based spectroscopic data an increase in amplitude for g-modes and a decrease for p-modes just before an outburst. Neiner et al. (2012) discovered gravito-inertial modes in the Be star HD 51452. They found that the mode amplitudes were linked to the presence of mini outbursts. In general, hot Be stars display nonradial pressure pulsation modes, whereas cooler ones display gravity modes. Despite those empirical evidences, the physical processes responsible for the outbursts and mass loss in Be stars are still poorly understood. Dziembowski et al. (2007) showed that high-order g-modes driven by the kappa mechanism are unstable in the region of the HR diagram occupied by Be stars. The predicted radial velocity amplitude due to an l=3 g-mode is ~ 20 km/s for a star with 4 solar masses, with pulsation periods in the range ~0.5 - 1.1 days. For more massive and hotter stars like HD 171219, unstable modes are found with periods of 0.5-2 days.  Pulsation analysis of a star requires the measurement of frequencies with both high photometric precision and high time-frequency resolution. Only space missions provide both conditions. Since NRP in Be stars have periods near 1.0 cycles per day, Kepler observations are especially important to avoid the frequency aliases due to the day/night cycle of ground observations. Another advantage of Kepler data is the continuous observations for months with a 30 min cadence that improves the chances to observe outburst events in our targets. Stellar seismology made a great leap forward thanks to the MOST, CoRoT and Kepler satellites. We chose targets in the K2 cycle 5 fields from those already discovered as well as new targets identified by ground photometry and spectroscopy made in the present year. Our targets have Kp between 7 and 14. Long cadence (30 min) is desirable for this research. We aim to have both Kepler photometric time-series and simultaneous ground spectroscopic observations (when possible) to measure Be periodicities and understand the Be phenomenon. Our proposal fits the Small category, with 20 targets in total. Our group have experience with asteroseismology and have already worked in the same analysis with CoRoT and K2 data (cycles 3 and 4).

Be stars, as easy-to-observe objects giving a privileged peek into the structure of rapidly rotating stars, are therefore among the best suited laboratories to investigate important problems in contemporary astrophysics, like the effects of rapid rotation on stellar evolution."

When the age and chemical abundances of metal-poor stars are known, it is also possible to obtain hints about the onset and early conditions of star formation in our Galaxy. While red-giant abundances can be derived using spectroscopy, their age is most difficult to obtain:  Unless the star belongs to a cluster, age determination via isochrone-fitting is hampered by the degeneracy of the isochrones in the red-giant locus, introducing a typical age uncertainty of 80%. Asteroseismology has recently revolutionised the age determination of red giants: With the seismically determined stellar radius, mass and evolutionary status, combined with information on temperature and metallicity derived from spectroscopy, it is nowadays possible to derive the age of a red giant with a precision better than 20% (Davies and Miglio, 2016, 2016AN....337..774D). 
RELEVANCE: The oldest star in our Galaxy with a measured age is the metal-poor halo star CS31082-001 (Cayrel et al. 2001 NATURE 409 691C). This star, a red giant with [Fe/H]=-2.90 dex, has an age of 12.5 Gyr, with an error of 3 Gyr (24%), derived using the thorium-232 to uranium-238 ratio, a challenging spectroscopic technique that requires an high signal-to-noise spectrum and clean U and Th lines. By joining the spectroscopic abundances and temperatures provided by RAVE with the seismic information from K2, we aim to determine precise stellar ages for 30 metal-poor stars. Presently K2 is the only instrument able to provide light curves for metal-poor halo targets: The CoRoT satellite observed mostly disk stars, since its fields were close to the Galactic plane, and the Kepler mission did not systematically target halo stars, while the forthcoming PLATO and  TESS missions are going to observe bright targets, mostly close-by dwarfs and subgiants.
AIM:  With this proposal we aim at getting the light curve for 17 stars, identified as metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-2.5dex) in the RAVE spectroscopic survey. The selection has been performed by combining the newly seismically calibrated RAVE catalogue (RAVE-SC) with the RAVE spectra classification tool (see Valentini et al 2016, arXiv:1609.03826, for details). 
METHODOLOGY:  Our group possesses the necessary tools for a complete analysis of the targets light curves and spectra: we aim to extract seismic parameters from K2 light curves, to then determine refined atmospheric parameters and abundances from RAVE spectra, by fixing the spectroscopic gravity to the seismic value (as in Valentini et al. 2016). By combining the spectroscopic abundances with the value of mass and evolutionary status provided by asteroseismology, it will be possible to determine ages for the sample of RAVE metal-poor stars with an error less than 20% ."

For this purpose, we have selected a sample of gamma-ray detected and gamma-ray candidate blazars that fall on the K2 silicon footprint during the upcoming observation cycle. These correlation studies can provide further insights into the mechanism responsible for the blazar emission and test the dependence of optical variability on blazar type."

These systems will allow us to improve calibrations of the age-rotation-activity relationship for field stars across a wide range in age. Flare rates and rotation periods will be measured using previously developed toolkits, and this sample will add to the ongoing analysis of Kepler and K2 wide binary systems.

Stars lose angular momentum as they age, causing their rotation periods to decline at a predictable rate. This ""gyrochronology"" method provides us with a means to determine stellar ages to within ~10% for Sun-like stars (Barnes 2010 ApJ 722 222). Wide binary systems help to extend the usable mass and age range for gyrochronology, and will be able to test new models of weakened magnetic braking in old field stars (e.g. van Saders et al. 2016 Nature, 529, 181).  A subset of the proposed sample contains white dwarf components whose cooling ages provide a benchmark against which their main sequence companions rotation ages may be compared.

Because slower rotation weakens the internal magnetic dynamo, flare rates are predicted to decline over time. As a result, older stars like the Sun exhibit very few ""super flares"". The detailed evolution of flare rates for main sequence stars of spectral types G, K, and M is poorly constrained, however, due to the small number of flare stars with known ages. Any wide binary component with a measurable flare rate and rotation age is extremely valuable for such calibrations. These systems will also become important benchmarks for other facets of magnetic activity, such as tracking the evolution of activity cycles and starspot filling factors."

So far, stars brighter than Kp < 8 mag were rarely observed with Kepler/K2 due to the large number of pixels required to capture the saturated pixel columns. We propose K2 observations of the brightest stars in campaigns 14-16, including a novel technique which uses a small number of unsaturated pixels. Asteroseismic studies of these targets will allow unprecedented tests of asteroseismic scaling relations which will pave the way for the success of the K2 Galactic Archeology Program, and insights into poorly understood internal processes of intermediate-mass stars such as convective core overshooting.

We will select all targets with Kp < 8 mag from the Hipparcos catalog. We will use conventional apertures and small (~24 pixel diameter) circular apertures around the saturated core for very bright (Kp < 6) targets. For the latter, we will perform photometry using weighted sums of unsaturated pixels in the wings of the circular aperture. The method (so-called halo photometry) has been demonstrated to detect pulsations for all bright Pleiades and Hyades stars observed in Campaign 4. We will also organize spectroscopic and interferometric follow-up observations that will be combined with the K2 photometry.

Our proposal addresses fundamental stellar astrophysics, a key science goal of the K2 mission. Our project furthermore supports galactic astrophysics, another key science area identified in the NRA, through the calibration of scaling relations for galactic archeology studies. A better understanding of stellar models through the study of bright stars is relevant for science goals pursued by both present and future NASA missions such as the characterization of exoplanets (TESS, JWST) as well as stellar populations and galaxy formation/evolution (HST, JWST)."

Due to their diversity in fundamental properties (e.g. stellar masses), low-luminosity red-giant branch (LLRGB) stars are ideal targets to tackle two key unsolved questions in exoplanet science: the occurrence rate of gas-giant planets as a function of host star mass and evolutionary state, and the role of stellar incident flux on the radius inflation of gas-giant planets. Our K2 program has already discovered the first potentially re-inflated Jupiter around an oscillating evolved star (Grunblatt et al. 2016), and preliminary results indicate an sharp transition in planet occurrence as a function of stellar evolution state. Here we propose to continue our survey in C14-C16 to detect additional planets needed to confirm these intriguing results.

We selected targets using Hipparcos and Gaia parallaxes, as well as spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, RAVE and LAMOST. The availability of Gaia parallaxes and the extensive coverage by LAMOST and RAVE will yield a significantly higher yield of bona-fide LLRGBs than in previous campaigns, making C14-C16 a particularly valuable sample to achieve our science goals. Planet candidates will be detected with K2 long-cadence data using a Box-Fitting Least Squares (BLS) algorithm coupled with a correlated noise model to account for stellar granulation. Since LLRGB stars oscillate with periods accessible with long-cadence data, we will use asteroseismology to precisely characterize both the host stars and the detected planet candidates. Follow-up high-precision radial velocity observations using Keck/HIRES and APF will be used to confirm the planets.

The proposal addresses two main K2 science goals: exoplanet detection and stellar astrophysics. Due to the low number of K2 short-cadence slots, our survey is the only K2 program allowing a systematic combination of asteroseismology and transits to characterize exoplanets. Kepler was not optimized towards observing LLRGB stars, and hence new K2 observations are required to address the key science questions of this project."

nearby, ecliptic M dwarfs with precise, long-cadence photometry and to discover a new population 
of rocky and potentially habitable planets and larger sub-Neptunes that are amenable to transit
spectroscopy. We propose to observe several thousand additional M dwarfs in the K2 campaigns
1416 fields (as verified by K2fov) to continue our successful K2 program that we call the K2 M
Dwarf Project (K2-MDP). We estimate 100200 small planets around late-type stars from
the full K2-MDP program. This new population of planets will drastically increase the number
of known M dwarf planetary systems, improve planet frequency statistics, inform theories of planet
formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres, and provide new targets for follow-up with current
and future observatories.

Our M dwarf targets are selected on the basis of high proper-motion, photometric colors, and
supplemented with GAIA data where feasible. Our approach captures the majority of M dwarfs
within 100pc of the Sun with little contamination. Our targets have median brightness Kp<15,
most are M3-M4 dwarfs, and > 95% are in EPIC. We prioritize our targets using expected transit
S/N, determined by comparing K2s precision to predicted transit depth for a nominal, transiting
super-Earth. We estimate transit depths by converting multiband to spectral type and then to R
and T ef f . Our team exploits knowledge gained from analysis of Kepler light curves to search K2 pixel
data for planet transit signals. Spectroscopic observations of candidate planet hosts provide stellar
parameters. Our full program, from target selection, to planet discoveries, to host characterization,
aims to provide the largest and most reliable sample of small, transiting M dwarf planets to date.

The K2-MDP team has made steady progress toward all our goals. Our collaboration
has resulted in nine papers published to date, with ten currently submitted or in preparation. Our
largest results are a full C04 candidate and validated planet catalog (Crossfield et al. 2016), papers
describing M dwarf stellar characterization and candidates (Martinez et al., submitted; Dressing et
al., submitted & in prep.). We have been awarded large, multisemester programs at ESO (for spec-
troscopic follow-up), Keck (for Radial Velocity masses), and Gemini (for AO and speckle imaging).

The proposed targets comprise a key portion of the K2-MDP program which aims to reveal
hundreds of small planets around nearby M dwarfs. Discoveries of habitable zone, Earth-
like planets and planets suitable for atmospheric characterization are primary science
drivers for K2 and primary goals of NASA. Our program will provide both the small, rocky
planets and key transit spectroscopy targets for early JWST Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO)
leading up to the GTO proposal deadline in late 2016; well before the launch of TESS. We also
re-propose all candidates and validated planets identified by our team in C5 (Petigura et al. in prep;
Livingston et al. in prep), in order to more fully validate the remaining candidates and to measure
TTVs and more precise system parameters for the validated planets.

The strength of the metal lines is thought to arise from the interplay between gravitational settling and radiative acceleration in an A-type star where the magnetic field is weak or absent. Stars need to be rotating slower than about 120 km/s in order for radiative diffusion to compete with meridional circulation. Most, but not all, Am stars appear to be members of binary systems with periods between 210 days.  The diffusion scenario makes predictions about pulsational driving in Am stars which are in contradiction to observations. Thanks to the micro-magnitude precision of Kepler and wide sky coverage of the ground-based SuperWASP survey we now know that many, but by no means all, Am stars have low-level pulsations and that even one of them, WASP-33, hosts a transiting planet. This amplitude difference is still to be understood in terms of atomic diffusion reducing pulsation driving for the slowly rotating Am stars.  Currently there are only three A-type stars known to host transiting short-period hot jupiters (WASP-33, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-57b). Finding additional A-type stars with short-period transiting planetary systems is imperative to furthering our understanding the formation mechanisms around hotter stars.  Using Kepler and K2, we have a programme to collect a statistically-significant sample of known Am stars, in order to: 
1. study the interaction between pulsations and radiative diffusion, 
2. perform a statistical study of the incidence of pulsations and binarity within the Am stars, 
3. search for additional transiting planetary systems around A-type stars.  Only 11 Am stars were observed during the Kepler mission. So far a further 100 have so far been observed with K2. For this proposal we have around 20 targets for Campaigns 14 to 16. This will bring the total number Am stars observed with micro-magnitude precision to in excess of 120.  The proposal team are experienced in the reduction of Kepler data using PyKE tools and in the analysis of time-varying photometry. We will conduct in-depth periodogram analyses to search for stellar pulsations and low-level variability as we have previously applied to Kepler data. We will complement the photometric analyses with ground-based spectroscopy as necessary.  The K2 mission provides a unique opportunity to investigate the photometric variability of Am stars at micro-magnitude precision. This will provide new insights into the competition between stellar pulsations and element separation processes, as well as the nature of the stellar (and sub-stellar) companions to these chemically peculiar A-type stars."

We propose to study the relationship between the masses, radii, insolation, and metallicities of small planets by targeting moderately bright stars with K2, conducting reconnaissance spectroscopy, and ultimately gathering high-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N. Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models.  This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright Kepler host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small, and the properties of the systems to date don't adequately sample the desired range of planetary and stellar properties.  We propose a ranked list of 14,287 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We will generate this list by first searching for all moderately bright stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 14, 15, and 16, and then using the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs. We also propose two targets, found to have planets in previous K2 campaigns, for short cadence observations.

We will identify planet candidates using the planet detection pipeline developed by our team members. We will vet candidates by measuring the centroid shifts, acquiring high-resolution adaptive optics images, and gathering high-resolution spectra. We will then conduct HARPS-N observations of the best candidates with small radii, and spanning the range of insolation and stellar metallicities.  The HARPS-N instrument, located at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in La Palma, Spain, is an extremely stable, fiber-fed echelle spectrograph designed to measure radial velocities with exquisite precision. All of the members of our proposal team are members of the HARPS-N Consortium, which has 80 nights per year of guaranteed time per year. The follow-up of small planets from Kepler and K2 is the top scientific priority of HARPS-N.  We will deliver the following value added community resource products to the NASA archives: light curves and estimated stellar parameters for all targets; phase-folded light curves and reconnaissance spectra for planet-candidate host stars; and tables of precise radial velocities for the subset of planet candidate host stars pursued by HARPS-N. Our team has already delivered such products for previous K2 campaigns; in particular, our 446 K2 reconnaissance spectra are the only spectroscopic observations listed on ExoFOP-K2 as of 6 Dec 2016.

Our campaign to measure the masses of small K2 planets with precision better than 15% will have a significant impact on our understanding of small planets. By increasing the number of small planets with precise mass and radius estimates, we will enable investigations of the fraction of rocky planets as a function of planetary and stellar parameters such as orbital period, the presence of additional planets, and stellar metallicity. Improving our understanding of the relationship between the masses and radii of small planets will provide useful information when selecting targets for atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope and prioritizing the follow-up observations of planets detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite."

This will be achieved using short-cadence (SC) data collected during K2 Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 (C14-16). This proposal follows similar ones submitted for K2 campaigns 0-13 (PIs Chaplin, Campante, Davies, and Lund).

The information contained in solar-like oscillations allows the internal stellar structure to be constrained to unprecedented levels and allows precise determinations of fundamental stellar properties (mass, radius, age). We seek to exploit the unique opportunity offered by K2 to observe targets for asteroseismology that are typically brighter than those observed during the nominal mission, thus benefiting from better independent constraints (parallaxes, spectroscopy, interferometry). This will make it possible to bring the full potential of asteroseismology to bear to test the physics of stellar interiors. To constrain our analysis further we plan for a spectroscopic follow-up of the proposed targets. By combining the targets observed 
during C14-16 with those from previous K2 campaigns that possess independent constraints we may calibrate seismic scaling relations. This will be essential in seismic galactic archaeology studies, which rely on the application of these relations. Including also targets from the nominal mission, we may study the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood and place constraints on the age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars. The results will be used in ongoing investigations that are relevant to this solicitation: - In C16, M44 and M67 will be re-observed, allowing us to combine new observations with those made during C5, from which solar-like oscillations have been detected for both clusters. M44 is similar to the Hyades for which [1] from C4 observations provided the first ever detections of MS solar-like oscillators in an open cluster. C16 is furthermore forward facing, allowing for contemporaneous observations from the SONG network. Such observations are vital to better understand the relations between observations in photometry and velocity.   - The targets will further expand the sample of benchmark stars having precise fundamental properties from asteroseismology to different fields in the Galaxy, which will be crucial to calibrate surveys as Gaia and the upcoming GALAH.

We estimate requesting for 30-50 targets per campaign. These should show detectable solar-like oscillations with periods of the order of minutes, hence SC data are required for detecting the oscillations. We will prepare analysis-ready light curves from pixel-data using in-house software - these will be made available to the community via the KASOC portal. We will apply well-tested analysis procedures to the frequency-power spectra of the light curves, providing both estimates of global seismic parameters and individual modes of oscillation. Detailed modelling using state-of-the-art stellar evolution codes will then provide the stellar properties.  The methodology delineated above has already been successfully applied to the analysis of K2 C1-8 data, for which we reached a very good understanding of the seismic detection yield - from targets awarded in C0-3, [2] showed a detection yield >73%. From C3-5 data we have found that solar-like oscillations can be detected for stars similar to the Sun, with characteristic frequencies around 3100uHz. We have also successfully extracted individual frequencies for these stars, hence enabling detailed seismic modelling [2].

One module in Campaign 15 observations will overlap with Campaign 2, while 30% of the field of Campaign 16 overlaps with Campaign 5. These fields provide unique opportunities beyond those of a typical K2 field. First, the three-year time baseline of observations provide an opportunity to detect transit timing variations (TTVs), which can be used to confirm the planetary nature of transit signals in the K2 data. The observed TTV signal from interacting planets can grow quadratically in time: planetary systems that may have an apparent linear ephemeris in 75 days of data could show significant TTVs over three years. In the cases when both planets transit, this can enable us to infer masses, densities, and eccentricities for both planets in the system. TTVs can also be used to infer the presence of non-transiting planets in the Kepler data by detecting perturbations on observed planets that cannot be explained by other transiting planets in the system.  The K2 overlap regions also provide the opportunity to detect the smallest planets found by K2. The overlap regions provide 40 square degrees of the sky which will be observed for a total of 150 days, rather than the 75 days of a typical K2 field, enabling the detection of smaller planets that would be below the signal-to-noise threshold of a single K2 campaign. These observations will enable us to detect smaller planets in systems with known planet candidates. Moreover, by re-observing targets from Campaigns 2 and 5 with transit signals below the standard 7.1 sigma threshold for detection, we will have additional opportunities to detect planets smaller than can be observed in any single K2 Campaign.

Additionally, the K2 overlap regions allow us to confirm and precisely measure the periods of long-period planets. Planets with one transit in the K2 data have poorly constrained periods; two planets of near-equal size can masquerade as one planet if only two transits are observed. With a longer time baseline, these planets can be confirmed and their ephemerides precisely measured.

There are 8,362 targets in common between Campaigns 2/5 and 15/16. We will propose to observe a subset of these targets. We will propose all 75 objects of interest detected with our pipeline (Luger et al. 2016, AJ, 152, 100; Kruse et al. in prep), which includes multi-candidate systems with as many as 5 transiting planets. Additionally, we will propose all stars with one or two observed transit events in order to confirm these planets and refine their orbits. We will also propose stars with candidate signals consistent with the presence of small planets which could be detected with an additional 75 days of observations. These observations will enable K2 to detect its smallest planets yet, confirm the planetary nature of any systems with detected TTV signals, and possibly detect non-transiting planets through their interactions with transiting planets."
GO16012,16,Philip,Steven,Muirhead,Boston University,philipm@bu.edu,"Skinner, Julie N",Activity and Planets at the Bottom of the Main-Sequence,"We propose to continue a K2 program to observe a carefully selected sample of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) with K2 during Campaigns 14, 15, and 16. UCDs occupy the transition from main-sequence stars to brown dwarfs (late-M and later) and are essential to understanding the formation and evolution of the lowest mass objects in the Universe. Historically, photometric monitoring of UCDs for transiting planets and rotational spot modulation has been hampered by their intrinsic faintness and the expected short duration of transit events. The K2 spacecraft provides an excellent opportunity to study these objects in more detail, thanks to the large aperture and near-continuous 80-day photometric coverage of each K2 field.  Searching for Transiting Planets Orbiting UCDs: The discovery of transiting planets (TRAPPIST-1) orbiting a UCD has had significant implications for the field of exoplanets.  However, the larger population of exoplanets around these small, cool objects remains unprobed and will provide important constraints on planet formation around the smallest dwarfs.  UCDs are small, all roughly the diameter of Jupiter, which implies deep fractional transit signatures. UCDs are also relatively bright in the infrared. A planet that transits a UCD, whether gaseous or rocky, would be an ideal target for near-infrared transit transmission spectroscopy, as has been successfully performed on super Earths orbiting mid-M dwarf stars with the Hubble Space Telescope. Future transit transmission observations with NASAs James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect biosignatures in the atmospheres of rocky planets, but only for those planets that transit ultra-cool dwarfs. The transits from rocky planets orbiting mid-M and earlier dwarf stars are simply not deep enough to search for biosignatures over the expected lifetime of JWST. Recent studies of short-period planet occurrence around early- and mid-M dwarfs show that lower mass stars have significantly more rocky short-period planets than Sun-like stars. Extrapolating to ultra-cool dwarfs, we expect a large fraction, if not all UCDs to harbor rocky planets with transit probabilities of ~10%.  Spot morphology at the M/L transition: Studies indicate that over 90% of UCDs show evidence of surface activity in the form of H± emission; however, the nature of the activity is not fully understood. Unlike sun-like stars, UCDs have fully convective interiors and are expected to have magnetic field morphologies markedly different from the Sun. With precise photometric monitoring of UCDs with K2 we will measure the morphology of spots on the surfaces of UCDs via light curve inversion. We will also search for flare events and correlate those flare events to specific spots structures.  Surface activity in UCDs is related to stellar wind and ultraviolet emission from their chromospheres, both of which affect the photochemistry in the upper atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets. Understanding the nature of surface activity on UCDs is therefore critical for interpreting transit-transmission spectroscopy, as well as inferring the habitability of any detected planets. K2 provides a unique opportunity to study ultra-cool dwarfs in a way never before realized."
GO16013,16,Teo,,Mocnik,Keele University,t.mocnik@keele.ac.uk,"Southworth, John; Hellier, Coel","Short-cadence observations of WASP-104, K2-38 and K2-34","We propose to observe three planetary systems in the short-cadence observing mode: WASP-104 (Smith et al. 2014, Campaign 14), K2-38 (Sinukoff et al. 2016, Campaign 15) and K2-34 (Hirano et al. 2016, Lillo-Box et al. 2016, Campaign 16).

WASP-104 hosts a transiting hot Jupiter with a short orbital period of 1.8d. According to the current system parameters and assuming the optical geometric albedo of 0.1, this short-period planet should produce reflectional phase-curve modulation with a semi-amplitude of ~27ppm. For a bright (V=11.1) and photometrically quiet host star, such reflectional modulation should be detectable using K2 photometry. Although the previous ground based photometric observations placed a 4mmag upper limit on rotational modulation, the stellar G8 spectral type suggests that some starspots could still be present. If so, the short-cadence observations may reveal starspot occultation events, a valuable detection for determining precise stellar rotational period and obliquity.

K2-38 has been observed by the K2 during the observing Campaign 2 in the long-cadence observing mode, which resulted in the discovery of a transiting hot super-Earth and a hot sub-Neptune. This compact planetary configuration is an ideal candidate to search for transit-timing variations. The 1-min short-cadence is essential as it provides a much improved precision of individual transits' timing measurements compared to long-cadence.

K2-34 is transited by a slightly inflated hot Jupiter, which was discovered using the K2 long-cadence photometry from the observing Campaign 5. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain why some of the planets are inflated, and expanding the sample of inflated planets with accurate parameters is of particular interest. The K2 Campaign 5 lightcurve has indicated a possible rotational modulation with a period of 19d. Additional photometric dataset would put this detection to the test. Since rotational modulations are caused by the presence of starspots, the short-cadence K2 lightcurve may exhibit any potential starspot occultation events.

In addition to science goals mentioned above, the research of all three planetary systems would benefit from the short-cadence K2 observations in several aspects: refinement of system parameters with improved precision, search for transit-timing variations, additional transiting planets, phase-curve modulation, starspot occultations and rotational modulation.

Our team has developed a data reduction procedure to correct the drift artefacts from the K2 short-cadence lightcurves to restore the near-original Kepler-like photometric precision (Mocnik et al. 2016). We also have experience with K2 short-cadence data analysis."
GO16014,16,Aleks,,Scholz,University of St Andrews,as110@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Peterson, Dawn E; Matt, Sean P; Stelzer, Beate; Damasso, Mario","Rotation of M dwarfs: spindown, activity, and gyrochronology","Stellar rotation is a fundamental parameter for the evolution of stars and planets. Perhaps the biggest challenge in this context is to explain the spindown and the rotation-activity interplay in very low mass stars with spectral type M -- the most abundant type of star in our Galaxy.  Our best spindown models which very successfully reproduce the rotation rates of FGK stars, encounter many problems in the M dwarf regime (Gallet & Bouvier 2013, Mohanty & Reiners 2012). In addition, the gyrochronology period-age relations established for FGK stars do not apply to M dwarfs. A successful theory of the spindown of M dwarfs is going to lead to new insights into magnetic field generation, wind physics, and habitability of planets (e.g., Matt et al. 2012). For a better understanding of the connection between activity, rotation, and age, we suggest to observe a well-defined sample of nearby M dwarfs with well-studied activity properties in the Kepler K2 mission.  The ideal parameter to constrain models is the rotation period which can be measured with high accuracy from photometric monitoring. Because M dwarfs have long spindown timescales (>1 Gyr), obtaining periods for evolved objects is critical. While large samples of periods exist for M dwarfs in clusters up to 600 Myr (Scholz et al. 2011), the situation is much different for the field. From the ground, rotation periods have only been measured for small (~50), biased samples of M dwarfs (Irwin et al. 2011). Interestingly, these few periods show a wide spread from a few hours up to 150 d, in stark contrast to the periods of more massive stars.  Measuring rotation periods for field M dwarfs is very challenging from the ground, due to the wide spread in periods, the low amplitudes, and the faintness of the objects. While a large sample of M dwarfs have been covered in the original Kepler field (McQuillan et al.2013), most of them are too distant for detailed characterisation (distance, age, binarity, activity levels). The wide sky coverage of the K2 mission represents a unique opportunity to tackle this problem.  Recent survey work has provided excellent, nearly complete samples of M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. The Superblink catalog by Lepine & Gaidos (2011) comprises an all-sky list of 8889 M dwarf candidates brighter than J=10, most of them within 60 pc, with estimated spectral types ranging from K7 to M7. Detailed follow-up for these objects is underway. Lepine et al. (2013) confirm spectroscopically that the candidate list contains very litte (<10%) contamination. All these objects will soon have information on parallaxes, kinematics, and binarity from Gaia, which should provide good constraints on ages and masses. A large fraction of them have been detected in UV or X-rays, allowing for detailed activity studies (Stelzer et al. 2013).  Here we propose to investigate the rotation periods of the Superblink M dwarfs using Kepler. Several hundred of them (about 30 per field) are likely to be covered by the K2 fields from 2014 to 2017. We have successfully applied for time in previous campaigns and the lightcurves for campaigns 0-5 are fully analysed and the paper is published  (Stelzer et al., A&A, 2016). The analysis for campaigns 6-9 is underway, observations for campaign 11-13 are approved. For fields 14-16, we propose to include again about 100 targets in the K2 fields for long-cadence (30 min) monitoring. We anticipate that most of them will fall onto the Kepler chips. Our team combines expertise in period search and time series analysis, magnetic activity and spindown modeling. The data from this run will be analysed in a timely manner using the procedures developed for previous campaigns."

Occasionally, however, K2 re-observes portions of the sky that it has already surveyed, so it is possible to use existing K2 data to plan future observations. We propose Cycle 5 K2 observations of targets observed in previous K2 campaigns, with a particular focus on stars hosting transiting planet candidates. During Cycle 5, portions of Fields 2 and 5 will be reobserved (during Campaigns 15 and 16, respectively). We have produced light curves of stars that could be re-observed during Cycle 5 and searched both by eye and by an automated pipeline to identify planet candidates and interesting variables. We propose short-cadence observations of some of the more interesting planet candidates which would benefit most from improved sampling.

Observing targets across multiple campaigns brings a number of benefits. Chiefly, it allows improved constraints on the timing of periodic signals like transiting planets. Additionally, knowing about planet candidates before K2 observations makes short cadence observations of interesting candidates possible, which can significantly improve transit parameters and can reveal transit-timing variations.  Lastly, the longer duration of observations allows for study the evolution of phenomena (like stellar magnetic activity) that vary on timescales longer than a single campaign.

Module 2 of Field 15 overlaps nearly entirely with Module 23 of Field 2, and almost 30% of Field 5 overlaps with Field 16. We have reduced light curves from these overlapping regions following Vanderburg & Johnson (2014) and searched for transiting planets using the methodology of Vanderburg et al. (2016). In addition, we visually inspected each overlapping light curve by eye to find planet candidates missed by our automated search (including planet candidates with single or few transits), and also to find other interesting or noteworthy variable stars such as young dipper stars (e.g. Ansdell et al. 2016).  We propose short-cadence observations of several systems. One of these systems is K2-38 (Sinukoff et al. 2016), a two-planet system around a bright solar-type star, which already has an RV mass measurement. Short cadence observations will improve the measurement of the planet radius, giving better constraints on the planets bulk composition. Other systems for which we propose short cadence observations include several planetary systems in Praesepe (Mann et al. 2016). Short cadence observations of these stars will improve transit parameters and could yield spin/orbit alignment information from starspot crossing events."

Additionally, we propose long-cadence observations of hundreds of known and candidate white dwarfs, many of which are known to be magnetic, in close binaries, or harbor remnant planetary systems.

Overall, our program will more than quadruple the number of rotation rates measured for white dwarfs, putting strong constraints on the evolution of angular momentum in the final stages of stellar evolution. We will also characterize the orbital periods of many new post-common-envelope binaries (close WD+dM), informing Type Ia supernova population synthesis models. The proposed observations will provide the capstone for our legacy dataset of white dwarf variability with K2, which will revolutionize our understanding of stellar remnants for the next decade."

Like gas giant planets, very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs form condensate clouds in their atmospheres. For the nearest ultracool dwarfs, K2 can uniquely characterize variability due to these clouds, both rotation modulation on a timescale of hours and weather evolution of the clouds on timescales from days to months. Magnetic activity changes dramatically at the stellar/substellar hydrogen-burning limits. We have already demonstrated that ultracool dwarfs can generate white light flares and superflares in our previous Kepler and K2 campaigns, but increasing the sample size is important to constraint the rate of these rare events as a function of effective temperature and age. Flares are tied to magnetic reconnection rates and the energy budget. We also aim to detect transiting exoplanets by continuing to monitor each available ultracool dwarf in K2 campaigns; brown dwarfs, gas giants, and even large rocky planets are detectable. The K2 targets include nearby field late-M and L dwarfs, and even faint targets are valuable, since transits may be total and flares can be 20-40 times the photosphere in the Kepler filter. Campaign 15 includes the key target 2MASSW J1507476-162738, a bright L5 dwarf at 7.2 pc."
GO16019,16,Elme,,Breedt,University of Warwick,E.Breedt@warwick.ac.uk,,Accretion disc variability in Cataclysmic Variables,"Accretion discs are a common occurrence in the universe. They exist on physical scales spanning orders of magnitude, ranging from the parsec scale discs which power active galactic nuclei to protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables (few thousand km). The flow of material and angular momentum through these discs are governed by the same underlying physical processes, but timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion discs around cataclysmic variables (CVs) are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure and the effects of accretion rate variations, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Continuing our programme from campaigns 0 to 13, we propose to monitor the CVs and X-ray binaries in the K2 fields with the aim of building a library of high quality light curves that can be used to investigate disc-based phenomena. CVs and other accreting compact objects display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and disc precession (days). The unique capability of Kepler/K2 to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is key to understand accretion and accretion variability over such a wide range of timescales.

We will request 40 targets in Cycle 5, in a mix of long and short cadence mode."

For instance, the only rocky exoplanets for which mass estimates have been made (except for the few fortuitous systems that exhibit transit-timing variations) are those in ultra-short period orbits  Kepler-10 b and Kepler-78 b are two famous examples. Moreover, understanding the origins of ultra-short period planets may elucidate key processes in formation and evolution. Gas disk migration may have brought the objects in from where they formed but would require disks extending to nearly the stellar surfaces, contrary to observations and theoretical expectations that stellar magnetospheres truncate gas disks much farther out. On the other hand, if such planets were scattered in by dynamical interactions with other planets in the system, then we would expect to find additional planets around most stars with ultra-short-period planets, making those systems good targets for follow-up radial velocity searches. Furthermore, ultra-short-period planets that are the cores of evaporated hot Jupiters are likely much denser than planets similar to Earth that were scattered in, offering a way to test the frequency of each theoretical formation method -- if the targets are bright enough for us to collect high-precision radial velocity data to measure the mass.

We propose to collect photometric observations of stars that may host ultra-short period planets (with periods < 1 day) using the K2 mission. We will convert the raw K2 images into light curves and search for transits. We will follow up putative transit candidates with spectral, radial velocity, and high-spatial resolution observations to continue the already fruitful and exciting search for ultra-short period planets. All candidates and their suitability for followup will be regularly published and updated online for the general community.

Targets  Our targets are bright main-sequence G-M stars, select specifically so they will be most suitable for radial velocity (RV) mass measurements. All targets have been checked to fall on K2 silicon (code 2). We request that our targets be observed even if this proposal is not selected for funding.

Methodology  For Task 1, we will generate photometric time series from the raw K2 images, and the Kepler PyKE python package provides the necessary capabilities, based on Vanderburg & Johnson (2014). For Task 2, we will detrend light curves and apply an automated search algorithm (EEBLS  Kovacs et al., 2002) to find transits, as we have with previous campaigns (Adams et al. 2016). We will also perform photometric and pixel-level analyses to vet candidate signals. For Task 3, for vetted candidates, we will characterize host stars and collect RV observations using low-precision spectra to rule out binaries and blend scenarios. For available targets, we will collect and analyze precise RVs from the HRS spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory to confirm candidates as planets and estimate their masses. For targets inaccessible from McDonald, we will propose for follow-up observations at another suitable facility (e.g. Keck). We will also conduct high-spatial resolution observations using the Robo-AO system to rule out possible blend scenarios masquerading as planets and to get accurate stellar and planetary parameters.

Relevance  This proposal will use the unique capabilities of the K2 mission to look for an unusual and astrophysically compelling class of planet.

Much of exoplanet science hinges on a thorough understanding of the planets host star. As a result of the push toward lower mass and more widely separated exoplanets, it has become increasingly important to properly characterize exoplanet hosts and efficiently distinguish the signals from planets from signals from the star itself. Currently, stellar physical processes on the surfaces of stars poses a major deterrent to our ability to detect exoplanets. In radial velocity (RV) measurements, these processes induce noise, coined jitter, that can imitate or drown out the signals of planets. As new transiting planets are discovered by K2 and TESS, it will be imperative to have new methods of prioritizing ground-based RV follow-up, especially given that Kepler alone provided more planet candidates than can be followed-up in a reasonable time-frame with all ground-based resources combined. By accurately predicting the level of stellar jitter of a host star, we can readily identify the most promising targets for both the RV follow-up of transiting planet candidates and the RV discovery of new exoplanets. 
	We propose to use the high-precision light curves from the K2 mission with archival RV jitter and activity measurements to (1) develop an empirical relation between RV jitter and light curve variations, following the methodology developed by Bastien et al. (2014) and (2) determine the dependency of the relation on age, spectral type, and magnetic activity. These relations will prove useful for RV follow-up of existing transiting exoplanet candidates. We will use them to identify targets that have low levels of RV jitter and use them to uncover the physical causes of RV jitter, which will help optimize the use of upcoming RV facilities like NASAs NEID spectrograph.  2.	Description of Methodology to be Used
Bastien et al. (2014) showed that short-timescale light curve variations, called flicker are strongly correlated with RV jitter for magnetically inactive stars. Current work involves extending this relation from the 12 California Planet Survey (CPS) stars in the Kepler field to stars in the K2 campaigns. Due to the multiple fields of the K2 mission, there is larger overlap between CPS stars and potential K2 targets. Past and future K2 campaigns (0-11) have increased the initial CPS-Kepler sample by nearly 50 stars. Here we have identified roughly 30 stars across Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 of the K2 mission with existing RV time series from CPS, which will provide further refinement of this empirical relation. More importantly, they will allow coverage over a wider range of spectral types, ages, and activity levels. Thus, we will be able to fully explore the photometric manifestations of RV jitter and develop the tools necessary for improved RV target selection in a timeframe suitable for the upcoming space missions and ground-based instruments, such as the TESS mission or the NEID spectrograph."

We have data from 20 Fermi gamma-ray blazars in hand or being processed and observations of 3 more are scheduled.  Our ongoing K2 observations have already detected significant optical variability in ~ 83% of gamma-ray blazars, including binary black hole candidate OJ 287, ~ 16 of radio loud quasars, and ~ 5 of radio quiet quasars.   Our  scientific goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in the blazars at the time of K2 observations. Three candidate origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk with one or more thermal emitting regions. We will also determine if the origin of emission from the re-observable  blazar 3C 207 has changed since 2015. We will compare the optical variability amplitude and power spectral densities   of the gamma-ray blazars to those of less extreme blazars, and to those of their parent class of radio loud quasars, and to those of the much larger class of radio quiet quasars -- on hours-to-months timescales.  Data from the latter classes are in hand or scheduled for observations. We will measure the power spectral densities of the light curves and determine the power spectral densities' slopes which are related to the underlying variability processes, such as turbulence in the relativistic jets or stochastic fluctuations in thermal emission from segments of the accretion disk.  Relevance: The proposed research is relevant to the K2 Cycle 5 solicitation because we will carry out an investigation of science targets using the high precision photometry of the K2 mission with the goal of understanding the origin of optical emission in the cores of active galactic nuclei.

A major result from surveys for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars.  This trend is not seen, however, around super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al 2015).  We propose to search a large sample of sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] < 0.0) stars in the fields of K2 GO Cycle 5 Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 for transiting planets of all sizes.  Stars in this metallicity range fall into three populations: a) the thin-disk (which also extends into super-solar metallicity), b) the thick-disk, and c) the halo (which extends to extremely metal poor stars). These three populations differ both kinematically and chemically.  Thick disk stars exhibit a larger vertical scale height in the galactic orbits, and they also show alpha-capture element abundances enhanced by about a factor of two over thin-disk stars.  Halo stars show even more extreme kinematics and also exhibit significant enhancement of alpha-capture elements.  K2 field 14, being located at high galactic latitude, will be especially important for its larger fraction of thick disk and halo stars than are found in fields at lower galactic latitude. The discovery of the Kepler-444 system (Campante et al 2015), which comprises five sub-Earth size planets orbiting an ancient (11.2 Gy age) thick-disk star with significantly sub-solar metallicity ([Fe=H]=-0.69 +/- 0.09 dex) shows that planet formation started very early in the history of the galaxy.  We will obtain the data necessary to compute planet occurrence rates for stars as a function of stellar metallicity, stellar population and of planet radius.  For stellar metallicity, we will consider not just the standard [Fe/H] abundance, but also the abundance of the very important alpha-capture elements.  The goal of our program is to determine the characteristics of the first stars in our Galaxy to form potentially habitable planetary systems.

Methodology:
We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team for this investigation.  The DLR group (led by Dr. H. Rauer) will extract the K2 photometry and model the light curves.  The Cologne group (led by Dr. M.  Paetzold)  will search the light curves for planetary transit signatures.  The groups at Texas (led by proposal PI Dr. W.  Cochran) and the European KESPRINT consortium (represented in this proposal by Dr. M. Fridlund) will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates and Doppler tomographic analysis of any rapidly rotating planetary candidates.  The group at Australian National University (led by Dr. D. Yong) will perform detailed spectral analysis of our follow-up data in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances.

Targets:
We will propose a large sample of 2952 targets.  They range in V magnitude from about 6.4 to 12.4, with a median magnitude of 10.3.  Thus, according to Aigrain et al (2015, MNRAS, 247, 2880) we expect to obtain a 6.5 hour CDPP of about 80 ppm or better.

Relevance:
We are searching for new exoplanetary systems. These results will provide important new constraints on the physics and chemistry of planetary system formation, as well as provide constraints for the computation of planet occurrence rates. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes and photometry, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? In order to answer this question, we need to understand their multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates.   The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above. Because of the limited precision on the ground based observations to measure rotation periods, we propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates as one of the key approaches to solve the width problem. In K2 fields 14, 15 and 16, we will observe 22 nearby systems, including two K dwarfs and 20 M dwarfs. One of the systems is GJ406, which is the closest dwarf at only 2.6pc among all K2 campaigns.

Stellar clusters provide a homogeneous sample of stars in which the major independent variable is the stellar mass. The different ages of the clusters will help us to understand the early dynamical evolution of planetary systems. We have assembled a large, diverse and highly experienced international team. The PICK2 project has already collected K2 data on the Hyades, Pleiades, Praesepe and Ruprecht 147 clusters. In K2 campaign 16 we will be able to observe different - and previously unexplored - parts of the M67 and Praesepe open clusters.

o) Methods & techniques:
We will search the K2 light curves for planetary transit signatures. We will conduct extensive followup observations including ground-based photometry, high precision RV measurement, and high resolution optical and near-IR spectroscopy in order to confirm the planetary candidates. We will perform detailed spectral analysis in order to derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Our team has just discovered a transiting super-giant planet or brown dwarf in the Ruprecht 147 cluster (Nowak et al. 2016) and has confirmed several new K2 planets (Johnson et al. 2016; Barragan et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2016) o) Perceived significance:
These results will provide important new constraints on the physics of planetary system formation and early dynamical evolution. We will address the Kepler mission goals of obtaining an inventory of the diversity of planetary systems around sun-like stars. We will also obtain data very complementary to the goals of the TESS program, and help guide planetary system science for JWST studies."

The secondary could be another white dwarf (i.e., a double-degenerate channel), the core of an evolved, once hydrogen-rich main sequence star [i.e., a Cataclysmic Variable (CV) channel], or a semi-degenerate helium star (i.e., a helium star channel). The probabilities to the three paths and identification of a particular path for a known AM CVn system are not well known. Recently we have identified several parameters that are predicted to identify the paths and even go further as to eliminate a path for a particular AM CVn system. Necessary for study of these parameters are observations of light curves, and in particular quiescence to and through Stage A of a superoutburst that is nearly always missed from ground-based observations. As such, we have a limited sample to confirm our predictions using ground-based data. Necessary are the observations we propose for K2 Cycle 5, Campaigns 14-16 for both AM CVn systems and CV systems. We need to observe CV systems so we can differentiate between the evolutionary path of a normal CV (i.e., white dwarf primary and main sequence or evolved secondary) and the CV channel for AM CVn systems. For all observations, we will simultaneously observe from the ground in the R band using the Sternberg Astronomical Observatory and in the V band using the University of Dallas at Texas observatories. We have put together a national and international team of experts to achieve these goals. This project will involve undergraduate student observers using ground-based telescopes."

By observing a sample of A and early F stars, K2 can help to expand the number of known planets around stars with M~1.5-2.5 M_sun. This population has been probed largely through RV surveys of subgiants and giants in this mass range [1], but the masses of these stars have been debated [2]. During its primary mission, Kepler discovered a handful of planets around A-type stars, most notably Kepler-13 Ab [3], plus ~60 planet candidates that are awaiting validation. K2 observations of main sequence A and F stars will complement (sub)giant RV observations, as K2 is sensitive to smaller planets, and close-in planets that have already been engulfed by the (sub)giants. K2 can thus be used to expand the sample of known transiting planets around these stars. There are currently only ~20 such confirmed planets; this population is currently almost totally unexplored. We thus propose to search for planets around such stars with K2.

Targets: We request 301 long cadence targets, ~1/2 of which will be in Field 16. This will build on the ~1500 targets we have been granted earlier in the K2 mission. The sample consists of A and early F-type dwarfs with 8<V<13, allowing for high quality photometry and spectroscopy while not requiring many K2 detector pixels.

Methodology: We will extract lightcurves of our targets from the K2 pixel data, correct these for systematics, and search for transit signals. We will conduct reconnaissance spectroscopy of planet candidate hosts using the 2.7m telescope at McDonald Observatory and the forthcoming NRES spectrographs for the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network, and high-resolution imaging with Robo-AO and the Large Binocular Telescope. For long-period targets with only 2 or 3 transits in the K2 data, we will conduct follow-up photometric observations with LCO and the DEMONEXT robotic 0.5m telescope. Any planet candidates in our sample will (by design) not be amenable to confirmation using standard RV techniques. Instead, we will validate our candidates using other methods. We will be able to confirm massive, short-period planets using photometry alone by searching for beaming and ellipsoidal variations caused by the planetary orbit, which gives the planetary mass and can find non-transiting planets [4]. A stars are typically photometrically quiet, making them prime targets for this technique. We will also use Doppler tomography (where we spectroscopically resolve the stellar line profile perturbation during the transit due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) to validate planet candidates, and to measure the alignment between the stellar spin and planetary orbit [5]. We will use the statistical techniques developed to validate Kepler planets for any candidates not amenable to phase curve detection or Doppler tomography.

Relevance: Our program will not only discover and characterize new planets around massive stars but also provide insight into the planetary population and planet formation and migration around these stars. It will thus address two of the science goals of NASA's Astrophysics program, namely, ""Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"" and ""Discover and study planets around other stars."" We require new K2 observations in order to expand the sample of massive stars that has been surveyed for planets, building on the sample from Kepler and our earlier K2 programs.

Two complementary approaches have been adopted, the first centered on in-depth studies of the Sun itself, and the second focusing on the study of solar analogs, stars which are like the Sun and thus might shed light on characteristics of its composition, structure, activity, planetary system, evolution, and future. The utility of the study of solar analogs is broad, ranging from finding night-time proxies for the Sun for calibration purposes to their use as snapshots of the evolutionary history of the Sun. Their study has helped to establish that chromospheric activity is key to understanding stellar rotation, activity, and dynamos. The project proposed here is aimed at providing a large consistent set of well-vetted solar analogs in order to address these questions. We will make use of the K2 mission fields to obtain precise photometric time series of approximately 1000 solar analogs, supplemented by asteroseismology and ground- and space-based spectroscopic data for the brighter and more promising candidates. From this data we will derive rotation periods, spot coverages, and flare rates for a well-calibrated sample of solar analogs. This work expands and extends our ongoing Kepler and K2 analysis, and supports an ongoing project under NASA's Living With a Star program; the use of new fields will also allow us to compare different stellar populations and provide a growing sample of test data for the study of stellar activity, rotation, and dynamos.

The chosen targets will be selected on the basis of existing ground-based photometry supplemented by spectroscopy when available and guided by previous results and population models using TRILEGAL. We anticipate that <10% of the stars in our sample will be giants, but we can make use of light curves and power spectra to eliminate giants from our sample after the fact based on granulation noise (Mathur et al. 2011, Bastien et al. 2013, 2015). We will reduce our limiting magnitude from the ~14 we used for Kepler to ~12.5 to roughly compensate for the increased noise in K2 compared to Kepler, and make ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up easier."

We request short cadence data on five carefully selected stars, including the brightest M dwarf in C16 field, a solar analog, and three bright G/K subgiants. We also request long cadence data on the next three brightest K or M dwarfs in the C16 field. Our campaign includes several precise RV instruments around the globe, including APF, SONG, MINERVA, PARAS, and potentially also Keck/HIRES and IRTF/iSHELL, representing the first organized, extensive, simultaneous RV campaign with space photometry.

Our primary science goal is to characterize and understand stellar activity induced RV signals (stellar jitter), which is the largest term in RV error budget. Mitigating stellar jitter is crucial for searching for Earth analogs and also building up a large sample of small planets with various orbital periods. This RV+K2 campaign will provide the community with an unprecedented dataset of RV spectra and precise photometry to study stellar jitter on a broad range of time scales, from minutes to 80 days. We will gather the first ever RV+photometry dataset aiming at characterizing stellar granulation, the most poorly understood term among all astrophysical sources of stellar jitter. This project will also enable the first asteroseismic studies with simultaneous precise RVs and photometry, while searching for planets in the brightest nearby G to M dwarfs in the field.  This project adds to the science returns of Kepler/K2 in a unique way by capitalizing the simultaneous observing capability enabled in C16. We maximize the efficiency of such simultaneous observing efforts by grouping together a team of RV facilities and experts around the world. The experience and outcome of this RV+K2 campaign will be invaluable for ground-based RV community in tandem with the upcoming TESS mission."
GO16038,16,Geraldine,J,Peters,University of Southern California,gjpeters@mucen.usc.edu,"Wilson, R. E.",Dynamical Activity in Algol-Type Interacting Binaries,"We propose K2 photometry of 18 binaries with Algol-type light curves in Campaign (C) Fields 14-16 to study gas stream impact and spot dynamics that influence the evolution of these systems. Most early-type stars begin as binary or multiple star systems, so an understanding the evolution of the Algol systems is critical for a more general knowledge of massive star and galactic evolution. All but one observation will be in the long cadence mode. In C16 we will have the opportunity to revisit three interesting binaries that were observed in K2 C5 and look for long-term variability. One system, S Cnc, for which we propose short cadence coverage is a well studied late-term Algol that displays a total eclipse. We plan to apply for observing time at KPNO to obtain spectra that will support the K2 observations, especially those in C16. The K2 mission and the modeling capabilities of the Wilson-Devinney (WD) binary system analysis program present a unique opportunity to probe gas stream dynamics and/or magnetic activity from the recently discovered quadrature brightness variations in Algol binaries that we call L/T variables. L/T is the flux ratio between the quadrature flux at phase 0.25 to that at phase 0.75 (Leading and Trailing hemispheres on the primary star). The L/T phenomenon was discovered in Kepler data and has never been reported in ground-based photometry. L/T behavior is likely due to changes in either hot accretion or cool magnetic spots. In the hot spot interpretation the impact site's location and movement can be diagnostic of stream dynamics that may be modulated by magnetic fields. In the cool spot scenario the variability is a consequence of magnetic activity on the mass loser. New data from K2 Cycle 5 will improve our statistical study of the percentage of Algols that show L/T inequality and indicate whether there is a preference for L > T or the reverse.   Modeling the K2 light curves with the WD program, stellar and spot parameters, including spot motions, will be determined so as to generate an image of the binary versus time.  Updates to the WD program will be made available to the community."

Following the recent discovery of exoplanets orbiting Kapteyn's star, a known local halo M subdwarf, and the determination of a very old age (~10Gyr) for the exoplanet bearing star Kepler-10, it is now suspected that stars of the Galactic halo population also harbor exoplanets in significant numbers. However, very little is known about the prevalence and properties of exoplanets orbiting old metal-poor stars because this population has been largely overlooked by most exoplanet surveys. In addition, the detection of eclipsing stellar companions is of high interest for stellar astrophysics, because it allows one to directly measure the mass and radius of a star, which in turn calibrates the fundamental ""mass-radius relationship"", which is a critical test of stellar structure and evolution models. We expect our proposed program to discover several of these important mass-radius calibrators, which would for the first time obtain mass and radius measurements for old, low-mass stars with low metal abundances. Our ongoing program has now identified three likely eclipsing binaries in K2 campaigns 4-7, out of 6,376 halo stars monitored. The small numbers shows how rare these systems are in the halo population, and emphasizes the need for monitoring larger samples of halo stars. Campaigns 14-15-16 are very favorable to this, with campaign 14 close to the North Galactic cap. Our astrometric and photometric analysis of these three fields identifies 3,959 high-velocity subdwarfs, which are unambiguous members of the local Galactic halo. We propose to monitor these halo stars with Kepler, in order to attempt once more to identify and characterize the first generations of exoplanets in our Galaxy, and to identify additional eclipsing systems to be used as mass-radius calibrators. Light curves of the targeted halo stars will be searched for eclipses or transits using an auto-correlation and Fourier analysis method developed by our team. Candidates will be targeted for ground-based follow-up observations, to confirm the existence of the transits/eclipses. Relevance: this program will directly expand on the original goal of Kepler to find exoplanets orbiting main sequence stars in the Galactic disk. The data collected on local Galactic halo stars will complement existing result from the Kepler mission by providing statistics and/or properties of exoplanets orbiting old, metal-poor stars."
GO16040,16,Michael,Thomas,Carini,Western Kentucky University,mike.carini@wku.edu,,Rapid Optical Variability in Infrared and Optically Bright blazars,"Blazars are extreme examples of the phenomena known as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The defining characteristics of blazars are a featureless (or nearly featureless) optical continuum, large amplitude and highly variable polarization, and large amplitude continuum variability at all wavelengths. Their weak or completely absent discrete spectral features leaves us with only continuum variability as a diagnostic of the emission mechanisms at work in these objects. Long cadence observations of a sample of optical and IR bright blazars identified in the F14, 15 and 16 fields of the K2 mission are proposed. The source sample will be comprised of less than 100 objects with Kep magnitude < 18 which are either already identified as blazars or sources in the fields found on the Wise blazar strip that are not previously identified blazars. The continuous, highly sampled light curves that will be obtained in the K2 mission will allow a detailed exploration of blazar variability on timescales of minutes to several months that is not possible with ground based observations. In particular these observations will allow: the determination of the minimum timescale of the variability, the determination of the slope of the power spectral density on timescales from minutes to several months, searches for breaks in the high frequency PSD which indicate the presence of characteristic variability timescales and searches for quasi-periodic oscillations in the optical light curves of blazars. Bright blazars are being chosen so that they can continue to be monitored from the ground post K2 in order to lengthen the time series and characterize the PSD across a wider range of frequencies."
GO16041,16,Sebastien,,Lepine,Georgia State University,slepine@chara.gsu.edu,,Rotation rates for stars in wide binary systems and a search for hierarchical triples in Kepler K2 campaigns 14-15-16.,"Wide binary systems are of high interest for both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research. Because they were born and ejected from the same parent star cluster, they also share the same age and presumably have very similar chemical compositions. At the same time, their large separations mean that they essentially behave like single stars, and can also be observed and studied separately. For stellar astrophysics, these systems represent a unique means of testing stellar evolution models at moderate to old ages (2-12 Gy), complementing data available for younger ages from the study of nearby star clusters or young moving groups. In particular, old wide systems are critical to test the predictions of gyrochronology, which posit a relationship between the age of a low-mass star and its rotation rate, a relationship that may prove critical for dating exoplanet systems discovered by Kepler and other surveys. This gyrochronology hypothesis can be tested by measuring the rotation rates of stars in wide pairs, and verifying that the rotation rates are correlated, which should be true regardless of what their actual ages are. Based on a search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog in the fields to be observed in K2 campaigns 14, 15, and 16, we have identified a total of 194 common proper motion (i.e. co-moving) pairs of stars with angular separations between 4 and 60. Our statistical analysis indicates that >90% of those pairs must be physical binaries in wide orbits (with the rest being chance alignments of unrelated stars). About half the primaries in those wide systems appear to be main-sequence stars of subtypes F-G-K, with the other half consisting of M dwarfs. A majority of the  secondaries, on the other hand, appear to be main-sequence M dwarfs. We propose to use Kepler to observe there stars in wide binary pairs, and measure their rotation rates from an auto-correlation analysis of their light curves. All the pairs should be resolved on the Kepler cameras (4 arcsec pixel size), although some pairs will have overlapping point spread functions and may require pixel-by-pixel analysis. Interestingly, many pairs can be observed in a single Kepler aperture, and thus may only need to be counted as a single target (or may use fewer pixels overall). One prediction of stellar multiplicity models is that very wide companions are often produced by dynamical relaxation in a triple systems, which means that a significant fraction of wide binaries may actually be hierarchical triples, with the inner system having a high probability of being a very tight (spectroscopic or eclipsing) binary star; this prediction will be directly tested with K2, by measuring the detection rate of eclipsing binaries in those pairs."
GO16044,16,Patrick,,Gaulme,New Mexico State University,gaulme@nmsu.edu,"Jackiewicz, Jason; Guzik, Joyce Ann; Harrison, Thomas Edward",Stellar Pulsations in Eclipsing-Binary Systems,"Binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like pulsations are becoming important astrophysical targets because they provide a way to calibrate asteroseismology. As illustrated by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, asteroseismology of solar-like stars is an efficient method to measure masses, radii, and ages of large numbers of stars, which is of prime importance to test stellar evolution. However, a crucial test of both asteroseismic masses and radii of a large sample of stars with independent measurements of those quantities has not yet been carried out. Eclipsing binary systems (EBs) potentially permit such an exercise by allowing for accurate determination of masses and radii of both stars by combining photometric and radial-velocity measurements, provided that spectral lines are detectable for both components (e.g., Gaulme et al. 2016).  EBs are also interesting for the physical processes resulting from tidal interactions, which may influence their evolution when the stars are close enough. As an example, Gaulme et al. 2014 noticed that among red giants belonging to EBs about a third do not display oscillations. They showed the shorter the orbital period and the closer the stars are, the weaker the oscillation modes become, until complete mode depletion is reached. This is observed in the closest systems where rotational and orbital periods are almost synchronized and where strong surface activity is detected. Beyond solar-like oscillators, the Kepler mission led to a much clearer understanding of the oscillation spectra of classical pulsators as RR-Lyrae, gamma-Doradus or delta-Scuti stars (e.g., Keen et al. 2015, Ouazzani et al. 2015, Kurtz et al. 2016). As patterns in the mode distributions are becoming clearer and inference on these stars improve, a similar need for ``benchmarks'' become important. Observing stars that likely pulsate and belong to eclipsing binaries are precious targets for studying stellar evolution in the common multiple evolution configuration.  In the field of views of campaign 14, 15, and 16, we have identified a set of binary systems with components that are likely on the instability strip, displaying oscillations from Beta Ceph to Delta Scuti, and maybe even solar-like oscillations. We will propose this set to be observed in the main proposal. Long cadence will be enough for most of the systems.  No funding will be requested.

(2) Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, Sonnett Space Sciences Bld., University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA The small size of a white dwarf (WD) star (approx. 1 Earth radii) implies that any sub-stellar or gas giant companion at suitable orbital inclination will completely eclipse it, while terrestrial bodies smaller than the Moon, including asteroids, will still produce transits that are detectable in high signal/noise light-curves.  Whether such planets actually exist around WDs is an open question. Those caught within the expanding envelope of an AGB star will be destroyed. However, the presence of debris disks around a few % of WDs (Farihi et al. 2011, Barber et al. 2012), and accreted metals in the photospheres of a surprisingly large fraction of such stars (approx. 25% at circa 1 Gyr, Zuckerman et al.2003) demonstrates that surviving asteroids and terrestrial planets must be perturbed into orbits that take them close to the central WD, where they are tidally disrupted. Even so, it appears dynamically difficult, though not impossible, to perturb them into stable, circularised orbits within the WD HZ. Alternatively, 2nd generation planets may be created from material ejected after the AGB phase.  The Kepler 2 mission is an ideal opportunity to search the HZs of a statistically significant (1000 to 1500) sample of WDs for terrestrial planets. Any discovery would provide vital data and a significant challenge to dynamicists and theoreticians, just as the unexpected discovery of hot Jupiters did in the 1990s. A single detection would then open the exciting possibility of studying the atmosphere of a nearby terrestrial world through spectroscopy with JWST (Loeb & Maoz 2013).  A Kepler survey of WDs opens up other serendipitous science than just the exciting, but perhaps tantalising prize of a terrestrial planet. Besides pulsating WDs, which can be studied in exquisite detail with high cadence mode observations, other variable examples will be discovered. Recently, Beuermann et al.(2013) discovered the first eclipsing, detached WD + brown dwarf (BD) system, and Casewell et al.(2012) found probably the lowest mass close companion to a white dwarf (25 - 30 Jupiter masses). Both BDs likely survived common envelope evolution, but what is the lowest mass object that can do so, and will it be revealed through eclipses of the WD? This survey will also reveal the full population of optically variable WDs at accuracies undetectable from the Earth. We have detected low level variability in circa 50% of the WDs in the Kepler and K2 Campaign 0 fields. These could be due to star spots or accretion of dust from disrupted asteroids onto poles of low level magnetic WDs. It is likely more unexpected variables await discovery.

The total eclipse of an Earth-sized WD by a Jovian or BD sized companion in a few hour orbit will last around 5 mins. In a 30 min long cadence (LC) observation this will be diluted to 17%. An eclipse by an Earth terrestrial companion in the HZ would last approximately 2.5 min, diluted to circa 8% in a LC datapoint. These can be compared to the expected Kepler 2 mission sensitivity at magnitude 19.0 of circa 50,000ppm(5%). Even at this faint magnitude, the Jovian sized object would be comfortably visible at 3 sigma confidence in a single datapoint, while the Earth-sized object would also be detectable, especially if many such eclipses/transits are observed and suitably phase-folded.

We estimate that our target list will be made up of 177, 17 and 242 WDs (campaigns 14, 15 and 16), that have been spectroscopically identified or are deemed to have a 60% or greater probability of being a WD (Fusillo et al. 2015), and which are brighter than Kepler Magnitude 19.5 from the McCook & Sion and SDSS catalogues."

Thanks to its fast photometric cadence, continuous monitoring and high photometric accuracy, Kepler has provided unprecedented insights into various types of compact binaries, and holds an enormous potential for other astrophysical domains on top of planet hunting. Some of the most notable studies have revealed i) the mass ratio and precise orbital parameters through Doppler beaming and Romer delays for compact binaries (Bloemen et al. 2011, MNRAS,410, 178), ii) stringent tests to the disk instability model through the precise characterization of dwarf nova (DN) outburst cycles and (Cannizzo et al. 2012, ApJ, 747, 117), iii) a plethora of currently unexplained periodicities in the AM CVn system SDSS J190817.07+394036.4 (Kupfer et al. 2015, MNRAS, 453, 483), iv) the discovery of the rms-flux relation in the aperiodic flickering of accreting white dwarfs (WD, Scaringi et al. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 2854), v) the discovery of a universal scaling relation linking the timing properties of Active Galactic Nuclei, accreting stellar-mass black holes, accreting white dwarfs and young-stellar objects (Scaringi et al. 2015, Sci.

GO16051,16,Roberto,,Silvotti,INAF,silvotti@oato.inaf.it,"Ostensen, Roy H.",A survey to detect first sdB Planetary Transit,"To date almost nothing is known about the final (WD) configuration of planetary systems.
Although not a single bona-fide planet orbiting an isolated WD has yet been identified, it is now widely accepted that the dusty and/or gaseous disks that we see within one solar radius around many WDs are produced by the tidal disruption of asteroids (Farihi+2010, MNRAS 404, 2123). Recently, a disintegrating minor planet transiting a white dwarf has been detected (Vanderburg+2015, Nature 526, 546; Croll+2015, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06434v1.pdf). An increasing fraction of WDs (>=27%) show a metal enrichment due to the fall into the WD atmosphere of ancient planetary material (Koester+2014, A&A 566, 34), whose chemical composition is similar to that seen in different Solar-system meteorites (Gansicke+2012, MNRAS 424, 333).
Theory predicts a gap in the final distribution of orbital periods, due to the opposite effects of stellar mass loss (planets pushed outwards) and tidal interactions (planets pushed inwards) during the RGB and the AGB phases (Nordhaus & Spiegel 2013, MNRAS 432, 500). While Gaia will discover WD planets at several AUs from their host stars, those external to the period gap (Silvotti+2015, ASPC 493, 455), this proposal aims to study the inner boundary of the period gap. Substellar companions to sdB stars offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the effects of the RG expansion alone (while WD planets are affected also by AGB expansion, thermal pulses and PN ejection, Mustill & Villaver 2012, ApJ 761, 121), and they are the natural 1st step to study the post-RGB evolution of planetary systems and their final architecture. Star/planet interactions during the RGB may be responsible for the stellar envelope ejection leading to the formation of a single sdB star (Soker 1998, AJ 116, 1308; Han+2012, ASPC 452, 3).
Among the first planet/BD candidates around sdB stars (Silvotti+2014, ASPC 481, 13), 2 planetary systems were detected by Kepler measuring the photometric modulation due to reflection/re-emission of the star light (Charpinet+2011, Nature 480, 496; Silvotti +2014, A&A 570, 130). Given that only 7 single sdBs were observed by Kepler for enough time to detect tiny photometric variations of 20-50 ppm, we can assume that 2/7 of sdBs have Earth-size bodies in tight orbits at ~0.005 AU from the star. With a geometric transit probability of 0.2 (Rp<<RsdB, RsdB=0.001 AU), the prob. to see a transit is about 0.057, i.e. in average we need to observe ~18 sdB stars to see one transit. Similar numbers are obtained for more massive sdB companions detected through RVs (Geier+2012 ASPC 452, 153): 16% of their sample of 27 single-lined sdBs do show small RV variations compatible with massive substellar companions.
Here the geom. transit probability at 0.005 AU is ~0.28 (Rp=0.9 Rjup) so that, in average, 1 sdB out of ~22 should show transits and secondary eclipses.
The main goal of this proposal is to detect sdB planetary transits and measure for the 1st time sdB planet radii by targetting in SC ~40 sdB/sdO stars in the 9 fields of K2. With typical transit durations of 15-40 min (at 6h<Porb<24h), SC is more adequate. The transit depth may vary between 25% (1 R_Jup) down to 0.2% (1 R_Earth). Thanks to the high number of transits in a ~80 days observation, K2 should be able to measure radii smaller than the Moon. If we find transits, PEPSI@LBT and ESPRESSO@VLT (both in or near commissioning) should be able to measure the star's RVs in order to obtain also masses and densities of these extremely hot and peculiar planetary remnants.
The secondary goal of this proposal is to detect photometric variations due to reflection effects by a faint stellar companion, ellipsoidal deformations, Doppler boosting. Kepler gave already an important contribution to this field. K2 can increase by a factor 5 to 10 the statistics of well studied sdB+WD and sdB+dM systems. We point out that the secondary goal is compatible with LC data."

astrophysics, and solving this will have significant ramifications for our understanding of how other galaxies form and evolve. Success
will depend on understanding the stars within our Galaxy: their role as its building blocks and the driver of its chemical evolution.
This demands precise measurements of the fundamental properties of stars, something we have currently achieved mainly for the
solar neighbourhood. Initial investigations in this new field of near-field cosmology  better known as Galactic Archaeology  has used
Kepler and CoRoT data and shown that asteroseismically-determined radii, masses and ages of red giants have tremendous potential
for expanding our view into how the Galaxy formed and evolved.
RELEVANCE: It is now clear that a lack of simple and easily reproducible selection criteria for the previous Kepler and CoRoT stellar
samples hampers our ability to faithfully compare theoretical models with observations. A dedicated Galactic Archaeology program
for K2 will avoid such limitations and in addition provides information on the Galactic morphology in directions complementary to
those already probed by CoRoT and Kepler.
AIM: The proposal aims to observe a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected red giants (on average ~5000 per campaign) to
probe the Galaxy far beyond the solar neighbourhood. This is a continuing program initiated during C1, and it is our intention to
make similar proposals for all future K2 fields in order to probe Galactic directions not probed before,
taking advantage of K2s 360-degree view along the ecliptic. With this data we aim to build a comprehensive picture of the Galaxys
structure and evolution from its stellar populations.
METHOLOGY: The K2 data will be used to determine radius, mass, and age of each star using asteroseismology, complemented by
ground-based spectroscopy from large surveys targeting both hemispheres (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, and RAVE). We will use
our seismic inferred stellar properties to stresstest state-of-the-art Galaxy models (Galaxia, TRILEGAL)."

Rotationally induced radial velocity noise can masquerade as a low mass exoplanet. K2 photometry of these targets will uncover the rotational periods and levels of activity, directly enabling more correct interpretation of the RV signals and the discovery of exoplanets. HPF starts its science observations in 2017, and of particular interest is the forward facing Campaign 16, where the power of the HET queue-scheduled observations enables HPF to acquire spectra and RVs on a number of bright M dwarfs simultaneously with K2 photometry, enabling techniques like FF' and Gaussian Processes to be brought to bear on the continuous photometry+RV data set. The goal of this project is directly in line with NASA and community goals of detection of low mass exoplanets in or near Habitable Zones of our nearest neighbors, and with Decadal Recommendations of using precision RVs to detect and characterize low mass planets."

Space data of these objects have led to a giant leap forward in our understanding of their structure and evolution through the discovery of new dynamical phenomena. Moreover, insight into these stars dynamics is of utmost importance to advance our knowledge of galaxy formation and evolution in the Local Group of galaxies and beyond. Throughout the K2 Mission we have been building a unique database of high precision RR Lyrae light curves from field to field, covering different parts of our Galaxy, and beyond. In this proposal we plan to study ~650 RR Lyrae stars in Fields 14-15-16. Our strategy assures that galactic structure studies and statistical analysis of pulsation properties (double-mode pulsation, Blazhko modulation, period doubling, low-dimensional chaos, non-radial modes) based on K2 data will be possible. Besides the ensemble studies, the analysis of individual stars will be equally interesting and important. For example, low-amplitude additional modes have been observed in all RR Lyrae subtypes, but their origins and occurrence rates are still largely unknown. We plan to complete our K2 Cepheid sample with a few Type II Cepheids in Field 15.  Targets. Approximately 650 RR Lyrae stars will be proposed (3-4 stars per field for short cadence observations) in the three fields, and 5 Type II Cepheids in Field 15. Field 14, towards the North Galactic Cap, contains 147 RR Lyrae stars, 11 RRd and 30 RRc stars among them. Field 15 has close to 400 RR Lyrae (5 RRd and 36 RRc) and 5 Type II Cepheids (2 BL Her, 2 W Vir and 1 RV Tau type). Finally, Field 16 offers 105 RR Lyrae targets (3 RRd, 22 RRc). Fields 14 & 16 do not have good Cepheid candidates. We will benefit from the overlap with previous fields (C5/C16 has 23, while C2/C15 has 2 common RR Lyrae targets); luckily both overlaps contain priority short-cadence RRc stars. Re-observation of these targets present a unique opportunity to assess our earlier findings that were based on previous K2 observations, and allows us to look at any longer term changes to our targets, such as Blazhko modulation, and the stability of additional modes.
 
Methods and community resources. Photometry of large-amplitude pulsators requires special treatment, and general-purpose pipelines may provide RR Lyrae light curves with sub-optimal quality. Therefore, we developed a specific algorithm (Extended Aperture Photometry, EAP) to deal with these difficulties. As a value-added community resource we publish a searchable database containing the light curves, frequency solutions and other parameters (Blazhko periods, additional modes, etc.) of the RR Lyrae and Cepheid stars observed by K2. Standard time-frequency analysis (by e.g. Period04) and study of time-dependent features are envisaged. Metallicities will be derived from empirical relations calibrated with high-resolution spectra. State-of-the-art numerical hydrocodes (Florida-Budapest, Warsaw) will be used to interpret the results. Synthetic galactic models (TRILEGAL) will be used to compare the galactic location and number of the observed sample with simulations.

Experience of team members. Our team consists of members of the Working Group#7 (RR Lyrae and Cepheids) of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium, who have been working on Kepler data (also preparation and target selection) since the launch of the original mission. Our scientists are experts on data reduction, pixel photometry, light curve and time-frequency analysis, as well as theorists performing numerical hydrodynamical modeling. We routinely analyze Kepler and K2 data, and published 20 Kepler/K2 RR Lyrae and Cepheid papers in high-impact journals. The group has access to ground-based follow-up (multi-color photometric and spectroscopic) instruments in Taiwan, Korea, USA, Canada and Hungary."
GO16059,16,Anna,,Marciniak,Adam Mickiewicz University,am@amu.edu.pl,"Szabo, Robert; Szakats, Robert; Kiss, Csaba; Mueller, Thomas G",Physical studies of asteroids with Kepler,"As it has been demonstrated in some recent papers, the Kepler Space Telescope in the K2 mission is an excellent tool to observe asteroids and obtain accurate lightcurves even if the targets are relatively fast-moving main belt asteroids (Szabo et al., 2015, 2016a) or Jovian Trojans (Szabo et al., 2016b).   While in the case of trans-Neptunian bodies the lightcurve information is available for a limited sample only (see e.g. Kiss et al., 2015), the general spin characteristics of main belt asteroids are relatively well know due to their proximity and relatively short (~few years) orbital periods that allows us to observe these bodies at various spin axis aspect angles during their motion around the Sun. The sufficient orbital phase coverage also allows us to apply lightcurve inversion techniques to obtain detailed shape models for these targets (Kaasalainen et al., 2002).  In this proposal our goal is to obtain lightcurves of slowly rotating asteroids with low amplitudes, to decrease the strong selection effects in spin and shape studies of asteroids. Currently spin and shape models are mainly available for targets with relatively short rotation periods and substantial elongations of their shapes that results in a biased sample of asteroids with known physical properties (Marciniak et al. 2015). Consequently, our knowledge on spin vs. diameter, the internal cohesion and strength or the non-gravitational effects are biased, too. Data from asteroids observed in the K2 mission can substantially increase the data pool for asteroids omitted in previous studies, enabling continuous observations of targets with periods of the order of days.  We also investigate small asteroids with spin axes close to the ecliptic plane. Some studies suggest their non-existence due to non-gravitational YORP effect (Durech et al. 2016). However, such lack can be a selection effect, because such targets often display very small amplitudes when viewed pole-on. Kepler/K2 data will allow us to decide whether the low amplitude of these targets are due to close to pole-on configurations.   We propose to observe a set of main belt asteroids for which additional high-quality lightcurve data obtained with K2 would enable us to obtain spin and shape models for the first time. Some of the targets, (203) Pompeja, (566) Stereoskopia and (308) Polyxo have rotation periods close to 12h or 24h and have small, <0.1 mag lightcurve amplitudes. These targets are difficult to observe from ground due to daily gaps and aliases, and would require coordinated observations from many observing sites, typically flawed by weather conditions. The Kepler Space Telescope is able to perform these observations alone. (525) Adelaide is a target with highly inclined spin axis and strongly variable amplitudes, sometimes being as low as 0.02 mag. Obtaining full, composite lightcurve of this P=19.967 h target would be very difficult from the ground, as the period exceeds the length of the average observing night. In practice, only continuous data from a space-based observatory can provide meaningful data for this target. (437) Rhodia is a very slow rotator with a period of ~56 hours, and variable, usually very low amplitudes. A sufficiently long, continuous measurement of this target would allow us to determine the orientation of its (likely) multiple spin axes.   All our 14 targets will spend enough time on silicon (typically ~5 days) that a sufficient light curve coverage can be guaranteed.  References: - Durech et al., 2016, A&A, 587, A48

GO16060,16,Marcel,,Agueros,Columbia University,marcel@astro.columbia.edu,"Mann, Andrew Withycombe; Kraus, Adam L; Douglas, Stephanie T; Covey, Kevin; Gosnell, Natalie M; Cargile, Phillip A",Why We Should Keep Poking the Beehive: Simultaneous K2 and Spectroscopic Observations of Praesepe,"Forty-five years ago, Andrew Skumanich proposed that rotation and chromospheric activity, a proxy for magnetic field strength, decrease at roughly the same rate for solar-type stars between the ages of 100 and 5 Gyr. This is thought to result from a feedback loop in which winds carry angular momentum away from the star, braking its rotation and diminishing the shear between its radiative and convective zones, which is responsible for generating the magnetic field. The resulting, weaker magnetic field then produces weaker winds; these continue to spin down the star and further weaken its magnetic field, but at a diminished rate.

While work in the ensuing decades has confirmed the general picture described by Skumanich, the details still elude us. But we continue to try to constrain the dependence of rotation and activity on age because a well-calibrated age-rotation-activity relation (ARAR) would be very valuable, particularly for lower-mas stars. Earth-like planets are most likely to be discovered in the habitable zones of nearby, old, M-type field stars (cf. the 1.3 Earth-mass planet around Proxima Centauri). Understanding these planets' radiation environments and potential habitability demands a robust ARAR that could be applied to their parent stars. If we knew how rotation or magnetic activity tracers, such as X-ray or H-alpha emission, depend on age, a measurement of any one of these quantities could be used to determine an accurate age for any isolated field star. Currently, however, we invert the process by e.g., adopting canonical ages for field stars to constrain the behavior of the ARAR at the oldest ages.

Few open clusters have been systematically surveyed for rotation and stellar activity, and there is a scarcity of accessible clusters older than ~150 Myr. The Hyades and Praesepe (both ~650 Myr) serve as the only anchors for our understanding of stellar activity across a wide range of masses between a few 100 Myr and the age of field stars (>2 Gyr). We have already extensively surveyed both clusters for rotation, including with K2, and for X-ray and H-alpha emission (Agüeros et al. 2011, Douglas et al. 2014, 2016, and in prep). Here we propose to complete the rotational census for Praesepe by observing ~500 members in K2 Campaign 16. This should yield ~150 new periods for the cluster; more importantly, combining data from Campaigns 5 and 16 with previous ground-based period measurements is a unique opportunity to examine activity cycles in an additional ~350 stars. To our knowledge, there have been no large-scale attempts to revisit period measurements for cluster stars, and these observations will provide us with valuable insight on the stability of the age-rotation relation over a baseline of at least ~3 years (and ~a decade for some stars).

In addition, we plan to conduct simultaneous, multi-epoch spectroscopy of ~200 Praesepe M dwarfs, likely with the Hydra multi-object spectrograph on WIYN. This will allow us to measure H-alpha emission, the main chromospheric activity indicator for low-mass stars, as a function of rotational phase. These data will test whether the observed H-alpha variability is due to active regions rotating in and out of view. Alternately, if stars with strong H-alpha variability also show strongly variable spots, that would imply that the magnetic field is rapidly rearranging itself. C16 provides a unique opportunity to use simultaneous high-precision photometry and multi-epoch spectroscopy to illuminate the cause and extent of H-alpha variability.

Our work will leverage existing data, our access to MDM, of which Columbia University owns 25%, the NN-EXPLORE program at WIYN, and K2's capabilities to investigate the stability of starspot distributions and H-alpha measurements.  Praesepe is a benchmark cluster for the ARAR, which can be used to measure the ages of exoplanet host stars. This proposal therefore supports NASA's goal of understanding exoplanetary systems."

Indeed, K2 observed the first such example in Campaign 1: WD1145+017 (Vanderburg et al. 2015), which we have followed-up on with high resolution spectroscopy (Redfield et al. 2016). Several researchers have explored the possibility of detecting very small objects, even down to exoasteroids, around white dwarf stars (e.g., Di Stefano et al. 2010, Agol 2011, Loeb & Moaz 2013). The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect, however, it would be very short, on the order of seconds to minutes, and would therefore require short cadence observations. The size of the host star also makes any followup observations of the exoplanet significantly easier (e.g., transmission spectroscopy of the planetary atmosphere [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2013]). Regardless of the relative ease of follow-up observations, the atmospheric measurements of a planet around such an evolved star, would provide critical information regarding the composition and formation of such objects (Veras & Gaensicke 2015). I propose a sample of ""bright"" (V < 18 mag) white dwarf stars, in which we would be able to detect objects as small as asteroids (i.e., ~500 km) and in periods that range from hours to months, including the intriguing periods in the habitable zone from 4-32 hours.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of relatively bright white dwarfs, we estimate the total number of targets to be about 30 (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns).

Methodology: Given the similarity in size between the host star and even small planetary objects, the transit depth will be substantial, and possibly even total. The detected debris disks around white dwarfs (Kilic & Redfield 2007) and evidence of planetesimal accretion onto white dwarfs (Farihi et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2014) indicates that there may be planetary material in close orbits. The first planets detected were around a compact object, a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail 1992). Additionally, N-body simulations of planetary systems through stellar evolution indicate it is possible to return significant mass objects back very close to the white dwarf (Veras & Gaensicke 2015), so it is likely for white dwarfs to host planets. Any object in the habitable zone (4-32 hours) will be easily detected with scores of transits in a single K2 campaign. Due to the shortness of any transit, these observations should be taken in short cadence. Even if a single transit is detected, follow-up observations can be done from the ground. While a search from the ground is possible, it suffers from severe aliasing with Earth's rotation. However, a followup campaign on known targets is quite straightforward. At Wesleyan University, we are conducting a ground-based search with our 0.6-meter telescope. However, the observations are limited to 1-2 8-hour epochs, making it difficult to definitively rule-out a transiting signal with periods in the habitable zone range, and extremely limited coverage of longer periods.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: A detection of an object transiting a white dwarf would be significant finding for many areas of astrophysics (e.g., stellar evolution, planetary migration, planet formation, atmospheric characterization), and in line with the objectives of the original Kepler mission, to identify planet candidates. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."
GO16063,16,Seth,,Redfield,Wesleyan University,sredfield@wesleyan.edu,"Cauley, Paul Wilson",Monitoring of Targets Within 100 Parsecs,"Science Goals and Objectives: Temporal monitoring of stars within 100 parsecs provides an opportunity to search for close planetary systems that are optimal for follow-up studies, as well as evaluate the stellar properties that are critical to the evolution of planetary atmospheres. A complete census of the physical properties of a star and planetary system is necessary for an evaluation of the habitability of planets. It is precisely these nearest systems that the question of habitability will be examined in greatest detail in the decades to come. I propose for consideration the sample of all nearby stars with reliable parallaxes within 100 pc. A planetary inventory of our immediate galactic neighborhood is attractive for many reasons. This sample is comprised of relatively bright stars, which means any form of follow-up (e.g., planetary atmosphere measurements [e.g., Redfield et al. 2008, Jensen et al. 2012], astrometry, direct imaging, spin-orbit alignment measurements, stellar metallicity, stellar activity) is easier, and possible with ground-based and space-based telescopes with a range of aperture sizes. This broadens the number of instruments observing these targets, encouraging independent confirmation of marginal detections, as well as experimenting with new observational techniques. Given the occurrence rates of short period planets from Freesin et al. (2013), it is likely that there are planets orbiting these stars. While some of these targets are likely monitored with radial velocity measurements, the hottest and coolest stars present significant challenges. A complementary transit search that is unbiased in this way, would be valuable.

Estimate of the Number of Targets: Given the sparse distribution of very nearby stars, we estimate the total number of targets to be 200-300 stars (based on the numbers proposed in previous campaigns). This sample is likely to be dominated by cool, low-mass stars (typically G stars or cooler, including many M stars). In particular, there are likely to be a few extremely close stellar systems, within the 100 nearest stars, that should certainly be monitored. The bright, early type stars are also important to monitor, not only because of the difficulty in getting precision radial velocity measurements, but also because they facilitate better opportunities for transmission spectroscopy of their transiting planets.

Methodology: Nearby stars are among the most well-studied stellar systems, making them an ideal sample to integrate the many components that go into an evaluation of habitability. An example is the evaluation of the stellar wind strength, which is critical to the long-term evolution of planetary atmospheres (Lammer et al. 2003). One of the only methods to detect the weak, but important, stellar winds of low mass stars is through the detection of the astrosphere, the analog to the heliosphere, where the outward pressure of the stellar wind balances the inward pressure of the surrounding local interstellar medium. This has only been possible with the nearest stars (i.e., within 30 pc; Wood et al. 2005, Edelman et al. 2014). While many of these stars are bright, and therefore more expensive in terms of pixel usage, it is worth pushing this constraint. Long cadence observations would be appropriate.

Relevance of Proposed Research to this Solicitation: While I have only touched on the value of these targets in terms of exoplanet detections and the assessment of habitability, there is a long list of other research programs that this data would facilitate, even if no exoplanets are found. These include stellar activity (spots, rotation, flares) and stellar pulsation. This work identifies a sample of K2 targets, which are directly related to the original Kepler mission of planet discovery, and directly tied to Objective 1.6 in the NASA 2014 Strategic Plan."

With an age and metallicity near solar, at a convenient distance, and rich in content (with 2000 members representing all standard phases of evolution from main sequence dwarfs, a well populated subgiant branch and red giant branch, white dwarfs, as well as tracers of non-standard stellar evolution such as blue stragglers, sub-subgiants, X-ray sources and CVs), M67 has been and remains a cornerstone of astronomical study. Equally significant, at an age of 4 Gyr M67 has nearly 100 solar analogues, allowing studies of the variations in properties of our Sun.

The ability to observe M67 was a significant motivation for the K2 mission. In addition to its scientific significance, the number of stars per unit area is well matched to the 4 arcsec pixels. In Campaign 5 a large superaperture on the cluster core efficiently captured 1700 stars, and yet is not too crowded to allow good results on faint members. At the same time, extensive prior studies permit efficient targeting of nearly 700 likely cluster members in the periphery.

We comprise a strong and diverse research team that led the Campaign 5 long-cadence study of M67. The team has extensive expertise with time-series photometry and Kepler in particular. We made the first unambiguous detection of solar-like oscillations in 32 red giants of M67, enabling for each direct measurement of stellar radius, mass and age; found no significant mass loss along the giant branch, unexpected in solar abundance giants; measured a mass of 2.9 ± 0.2 Mo for the yellow giant S1237, revealing it to be an evolved blue straggler with a formation history requiring three stars; and discovered four new detached eclipsing systems among main-sequence cluster members.

A second visit to M67 will re-observe at long cadence nearly 2,000 stars spanning Kp = 8 to 20 from Campaign 5, including 91% of the superstamp. Short-cadence observations will be made of 38 evolved stars. A major value-added resource product for the community will be light curves of the highest quality posted to MAST. Importantly, our team independently employs two widely-used and well-tested photometric pipelines to extract light curves from K2 data, so we can cross-check and verify any scientific results to obtain high confidence in their validity and accuracy.  With the addition of Campaign 16 data, we will: increase our frequency resolution and thereby determine internal evolutionary states and calibrate seismic scaling relations; increase surface-gravity precision to test evolutionary models; securely measure rotation periods to test new models of angular momentum evolution and anchor gyrochronology; detect oscillations in subgiants and thereby measure an independent cluster age; double our chances of detecting super flares at solar age; and increase our discovery space for small exoplanets or tighten our limits on exoplanet frequency.  Our team has broad and deep expertise in M67 specifically, with more than 40 refereed publications on the cluster. Mathieu will continue to provide scientific leadership for the project. Asteroseismology studies will be led by Stello, joined by Basu, Pinnsoneault, Silva Aguirre, Tayar and Zinn. Meibom, with Agrain, Esselstein, Pinsonneault, and Van Saders, will lead investigation of stellar rotation on the main sequence and angular momentum loss and redistribution during post-main sequence evolution. Vanderburg, Chatterjee and Jenkins will determine exoplanet frequencies. Sandquist, Latham and Mathieu will analyze the main-sequence eclipsing binaries. Soderblom, Davenport and Valenti will cover the evolution of stellar activity. Mathieu, Leiner and Geller will apply the time series to non-standard evolutionary paths such as blue stragglers and sub-subgiants.   We will make the best possible use that K2 observations of M67 can provide, both with targeting decisions, time series production for community use, and our own science results."

These parts (the bulge, thick disk, thin disk, halo) feature distinct stellar populations, and understanding the properties of those populations is an ongoing effort. Studying these properties relies on reliable fundamental parameters of stars: their masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities. Eclipsing binary stars lend themselves naturally to this task, since their favorable geometrical orientation and basic laws of gravity enable us to determine fundamental parameters to a ~1% accuracy. We scoured the published catalogs and proprietary KELT and SuperWASP data for all eclipsing binary stars in K2 C14, C15 and C16 fields. We propose to observe these stars and, along with other serendipitous discoveries of binarity in the fields, build a stellar population model based on the fundamental parameters derived from K2 data and follow-up multi-color photometry and spectroscopy. Studying the intrinsic differences in stellar populations across K2 fields will allow us to infer the dependence on galactic latitude and contribute to our understanding of stellar population distribution in our Galaxy."

We propose to monitor a set of CVs in the K2 fields of Campaigns 14, 15 and 16. The Cycle 5 fields represent the extremes of stellar densities with the directions toward the pole and Galactic center. We have matched the K2 fields with several CV databases and selected a total of about 33 targets for this cycle. These data will extend the range of CV types studied with Kepler's unprecedented continuous, fast-candence observations.

For Campaign 16 observed in the forward facing direction, simultaneous ground-based observations are possible. We plan extensive photometric monitoring of the brighter CVs observed with K2 in complementary filters and fast cadences."
GO16067,16,Brice-Olivier,,Demory,University of Cambridge,brice.demory@csh.unibe.ch,,Searching for Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs with K2,"SUMMARY. We propose to use K2 to conduct a detailed search for Earth-sized planets orbiting the brightest cool stars and brown dwarfs (spectral types from M0 to L8, Demory et al., 2013b). This population of objects presents several advantages for exoplanet surveys. First, cool stars and brown dwarfs are small and thus result in favorable planet-to-star area ratios. Second, because of their low effective temperature, the inner edge of their habitable zone can be extremely close (down to a few days only). Third, our targets are bright at infrared wavelengths, which will enable detailed follow-up studies. Our program therefore represents a unique opportunity to find a transiting Earth-size exoplanet for which atmospheric features (including biosignatures) could be detected with near-to-come facilities such as JWST. Such exoplanet has been discovered for the first time earlier this year. As of today, K2 represents an unprecedented opportunity to make this survey successful. This proposal is a continuation of our K2 campaigns 0 through 13 observations.  SCIENCE GOALS. Our primary science goal is to find terrestrial planets orbiting bright nearby, ultra-cool stars and brown dwarfs. Nearly all of the proposed targets benefit from spectroscopic observations that will facilitate the characterisation of planets transiting them. None of the small planets found so far with Kepler will be amenable to detailed characterisation, even with JWST. Our K2 proposed observations represents a unique opportunity to find a rocky planet for which a transmission/emission spectrum could be obtained with near-to-come facilities.  High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will also prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b).  RELEVANCE TO NASA. This proposal requests target allocation to search for terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of ultra-cool dwarfs with K2. This program will significantly improve our knowledge of the only population of planets (those that orbit ultra-cool stars) for which atmospheric biosignature gases could be detected with JWST in a reasonable amount of time. Our proposal meets three objectives of the NASA's Origins Program, namely the characterisation of exoplanets, study of planetary formation and the search for cosmic life.  METHODOLOGY. We perform the target selection tailored to fields 14, 15 and 16, as we did for the previous campaigns. Our selection is based on a compiled database of the brightest ultra-cool dwarfs based on the literature. This sample is thus clean of false positives and most targets benefit from detailed spectroscopic characterisation. We have also been developing a photometric pipeline using as inputs the K2 target pixel files to extract the photometric time-series (Demory et al. 2016). The aperture is recentered on the target star for each frame and, after centroiding, the time-series are detrended in a MCMC framework to remove position-dependent systematics. We trained our pipeline on existing K2 data and we obtain results that validates the feasibility of our program.  EXPECTED YIELD. We have assembled a list of 139 M6 to L3 objects for campaigns 13 to 16. Several targets have been observed in previous campaigns and have been removed for the target list to avoid duplication.

By combining this proposed program with our previous K2 efforts, we are building up a consistent sample that will allow us to precisely constrain the occurrence rate and physical/orbital properties of terrestrial planets orbiting ultra-cool dwarfs."
GO16068,16,Adam,Gabriel,Jensen,University of Nebraska-Kearney,JensenAG@unk.edu,"Redfield, Seth; Cauley, Paul Wilson; Endl, Michael",Searching for (More) Extended Exoplanetary Atmospheres Around Active Stars,"A key question in studying any planetary atmosphere is what happens at the boundary between the atmosphere and interplanetary space. This unbound, outermost layer of an atmosphere is called its exosphere. Several observations of extended atmospheres have been made (e.g., Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003, 2004; Linsky et al. 2010; Schlawin et al. 2010; Lecavelier Des Etangs et al. 2010, 2012; Fossati et al. 2010; Jensen et al. 2012; Cauley et al. 2015, 2016) in hydrogen (both ground-state and excited) and various metals.  Our team detected excited, n=2 hydrogen (through hydrogen alpha absorption) in the exosphere of HD 189733b (Jensen et al. 2012), the first such detection in an exoplanet's atmosphere. Follow-up observations (Cauley et al. 2015, 2016) confirmed this result by detecting exospheric absorption in hydrogen alpha, hydrogen beta, and hydrogen gamma, and also observed a significant pre-transit signal in these lines. The pre-transit signal is variable between the two observation sets and the physical interpretation is not clear. Jensen et al. (2012) hypothesized that the excited hydrogen in the exosphere (the transit signal) may be correlated with chromospheric activity, as HD 189733b, the only planet in that paper's sample of four planets to show H-alpha absorption, was also the most chromospherically active in the sample (as measured by S_HK and log [R'_HK] indices).  In Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 3, we proposed to search for planets around stars which are candidates for chromospheric activity in the Kepler 8 and 10 fields. We found dozens of suitable targets based on the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Survey's catalogue of chromospherically active stars (Zerjal et al. 2013).  A similar proposal in Cycle 4 was not selected for funding but a small subset of our targets will be observed.  We now propose to do the same for Kepler Guest Observer Cycle 5 for the Kepler Campaign 14, 15, and 16 fields. Because Field 15 is in the southern celestial hemisphere, it will have the most targets provided by the RAVE survey.  Adding targets from these fields will greatly improve the chance of success of the accepted Cycle 3 proposal at minimal cost of targets to the K2 mission (data from Field 8, which had a much smaller number of targets than Field 10, again due to the location of the fields and our reliance on the RAVE database, has been downloaded and is being analyzed; data for Field 10 and Cycle 4 targets have not yet been released).

Looking for planets around active stars with radial velocity methods is often disfavored because the stellar noise limits RV precision. However, this makes the transit method the more important way to detect planets in these cases. Furthermore, if any of these stars do have a transiting planet, they will be excellent potential candidates for follow-up spectroscopy with the large ground-based telescopes (Keck I, HobbyEberly Telescope) that our team has used in the past to detect exospheric absorption. The goal of follow-up spectroscopic observations would be to search for excited hydrogen absorption from an exosphere, including possible pre-transit signals. As a secondary science product, many of these active stars will have light curves worth studying on their own for stellar astrophysics purposes."
GO16069,16,Jonathan,E.,Grindlay,Harvard,jgrindlay@cfa.harvard.edu,"van den Berg, Maureen",Long-term K2 monitoring of exotic binaries in the old star cluster M67,"The old open cluster M67 has been a long-standing benchmark for stellar evolution studies. Detailed radial-velocity and pro-permotion studies have enabled an excellent separation between cluster members and fore- or background stars. Yet, even in the resulting clean sample of cluster members, we see stars that occupy parts of the color-magnitude diagram that defy explanation in the context of the standard evolution scenarios for single and binary stars. Blue stragglers that lie beyond the main-sequence turnoff point, have been known and studied for decades, but a complete picture of their formation is still lacking. The class of red stragglers or sub-subgiants, which lie below or to the red of the base of the giant branch, is a more recent discovery; attempts to understand their origin presents us with similar challenges. While examples of these and other stellar oddities are found in other old open clusters as well, the proximity, low reddening, and large body of existing data, make M67 one of the very few clusters where we can derive an accurate and long-term characterization of these systems' properties.  We propose to obtain light curves for about ten ""anomalous"" binaries in M67 that are known photometric variables, to complement their existing light curves obtained with a variety of instruments. By tracking the evolution in the light curves, we gain more insight in the configuration of the systems, and the physical mechanism(s) that underlie the photometric variation (magnetic spot activity versus heating, tidal-distortion or other effects). For the blue straggler S1082, the long-term tracking of the 1-day eclipse light curve provides a larger sample of eclipse timings; in turn, this enables a more accurate solution of the ephemeris and an improved measurement of the observed-minus-computed (O-C) times of the primary eclipses (compared to the initial analysis in van den Berg et al. 2001, A&A, 375, 375). This will serve to look for periodicities in the (O-C) residuals, potentially caused by the motion of the eclipsing binary around a third body, whose presence was seen in optical spectra. The dynamical link between the the third star (with an orbital period of about 1200 d; Sandquist et al. 2003) and the close eclipsing binary has not been proven, but could be established with the suggested (O-C) timing analysis. If S1082 is indeed a hierarchical triple, the complex nature of the system points at a formation scenario that involves at least five stars. For the sub-subgiant S1063, the period of the variability (about 23 d, see van den Berg 2013; confirmed by K2 campaign 5 photometry, see Nardiello et al. 2016) matches neither the spectroscopically derived orbital period, nor the expected rotation period, which makes the highly active corona that is inferred from the X-ray emission all the more puzzling. In this system, long-term monitoring of the shape and stability of the light curve constrains the processes that are active in this system. There are several more puzzling binary systems in M67 that we propose to observe in K2 Campaign 16. Each of these is interesting in its own right, but all have in common that they are valuable systems to explore so-far poorly understood paths of stellar and binary evolution.  Number of targets: About 10  Methods: For the proposed targets, the new K2 light curves complement existing light curves, including those from K2 campaign 5; light curves published in van den Berg et al. 2001, van den Berg et al. 2002, and van den Berg 2013; and unpublished time-series obtained by the PI. Analyis of the combined light curves (shape/periodicity/long-term changes) using a combination of existing and custom-made software form the basis of the techniques to be used.  Relevance of proposed research to this solicitation: The goals of this proposal are relevant to NASA's Strategic Goal to ""explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars and planets that make up our universe""."

We request K2 monitoring of unidentified and known X-ray sources in Campaigns 14 through 16, compiled from a variety of sources
 including the Chandra Source Catalog and the Million Quasar Catalog, to probe accretion onto compact objects at a variety of mass
 and time scales. Our KSwAGS survey found 93 bright X-ray sources in the original Kepler FOV (Smith et al., 2015). Approximately
 half were active galaxies while the remainder were active stars of various types (pulsating stars, rapid rotators, close binaries, flaring
 M-stars). A Kepler GO survey (PI: Still) of Chandra point sources resulted in a similar distribution of stars to active galaxies. High
 precision optical follow-up is scientifically useful for all sources; the AGN allow for a study of variability characteristics as a function
 of SMBH mass (Smith et al., 2015) and the stars allow for the study of a variety of rapid rotators and chromospheric activity (Howell
 et al., 2016). We received time for K2 to monitor KSwAGS sources in Fields 4,8 and 11-13. This proposal has identical scientific
 goals and will continue the K2 optical monitoring of X-ray sources, but with target selection criteria that relies on archival X-ray
 observations only and not on new Swift pointings. 
Previous AGN in the original Kepler field were selected using near-infrared photometric methods (e.g., Edelson & Malkan 2012).
 These methods preferentially select AGN with high black hole masses (MBH e 10^8 MSUN), since the method fails if the continuum
 is dominated by starlight rather than AGN light (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2012). Fortunately, X-ray selection uncovers low-
MBH, low luminosity, and low accretion-rate AGN. These types of AGN have predicted variability timescales short enough to be
 constrained by a ~80-day K2 campaign. Indeed, narrow-line Sy 1 objects (NLS1) are expected to vary on timescales of days to weeks.
 This science is complimentary to what we are conducting in the original field with high-MBH objects, since the accretion physics is
 expected to differ between these types of objects (i.e., low-accretion rate objects may have advection dominated accretion flows or
 other scenarios instead of the canonical optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk). This further monitoring will critically
 enhance the sample numbers of K2-monitored AGN discovered using a relatively unbiased selection method. We expect on the order of
 50-100 targets in each Field depending on galactic latitude.  Methodology and Relevance to NASA Astrophysics Science Goals 
We aim to use K2s impressive photometric precision to detect characteristic variability timescales using Fourier analysis. These
 timescales are the only possible direct observables of AGN accretion physics, which remains an important astrophysical mystery and
 directly addresses NASA Astrophysics goal to ""[d]iscover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search
 for life on planets around other stars."".  Additionally, these X-ray selected targets will fill in the phase-space of black hole mass and
 accretion rate, complementing our work in the original Kepler field."

We propose a short-cadence study of key nearby mid-M dwarfs. These stars are fully convective yet generate powerful magnetic reconnection events. We will measure the white light flare rate as a function of rotation and luminosity and compare it the flare rate in hotter and cooler stars. Davenport et al. found a universal template describes nearly all Kepler white light flares in the M4 dwarf GJ1243. We, however, have found evidence that M7 and later dwarfs have systematically difference cooling rates in their light curves.  We also find complex flares and interpret them in terms of EIT waves and conditions in the coronae. By studying active flare stars between M4 and M7 we can map these changes as a function of stellar temperature."
GO16073,16,Will,,Grundy,Lowell Observatory,W.Grundy@lowell.edu,"Ragozzine, Darin A; Thirouin, Audrey; Ryan, Erin Lee; Porter, Simon Bernard",Evolution of Spin States in Transneptunian Binaries,"We propose K2 observations of 22 transneptunian objects to constrain their spin states and learn about their formation environment in the protoplanetary nebula.  We are especially targeting binaries and potential binaries.  Their spin states preserve observable and interpretable signatures of their formation circumstances.  They are also subject to subsequent dynamical evolution, notably tidal despinning, offering opportunities to learn about those processes as well.  Disentangling these influences calls for a large sample of well-characterized systems to enable statistical comparison of ensemble properties across the various sub-populations.  This proposal contributes toward the goal of assembling that sample.  We will observe all known transneptunian binary systems on silicon during C14-C16, as well as a number of potential binaries.  K2s ability to observe continuously is key to teasing apart the rotational modulations of unresolved multi-body systems if they are different, or being able to determine that they are not, in cases where they have become tidally locked like Pluto and Charon.

We have assembled a team with all necessary expertise to fully capitalize on the data.  We have experience working with K2 data and have a proven processing pipeline.  We have a strong track record in both observational and theoretical Kuiper belt studies, including analysis of photometric lightcurve data, orbit determination, and dynamical modeling.

This project would be impractical from the ground.  The targets are faint, and weeks or even months of observing time would be needed to confidently extract the weak modulation from a fainter secondary not tidally locked to its primary.  K2 is ideally suited for this work.  Long cadence exposures provide adequate temporal resolution.

One of NASA's key strategic goals in planetary science is advancing knowledge of the origin and history of the Solar System.  This proposal is aimed squarely at that goal, specifically for the transneptunian region where our targets formed.  We aim to shed light on how the Sun's inventory of planets and minor bodies originated and subsequently evolved to its current dynamical configuration and compositional state.  Observations of the Cold Classical sub-population of transneptunian objects also provide valuable context for NASA's upcoming flyby and detailed study of one such object, 2014 MU69, along with the more distant observations of a larger sample of them that New Horizons is doing as it cruises through that region of the Kuiper belt."
GO16074,16,Niall,R,Deacon,University of Hertfordshire,nialldeacon@hotmail.com,"Mann, Andrew Withycombe; Kraus, Adam L",The effect of wide binaries on planet occurrence - K2 Cycle 5,"We plan to observe a sample of wide binaries spread across the K2 fields to constrain the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence and to provide benchmark systems for gyrochronology.

 
Science Goal 1: Probe the effect of wide multiplicity on planet occurrence.} Wide companions are common in the field; Raghavan et al (2010) found that >20% of solar-type stars have a companion wider than 100AU. Any link between planet occurrence and wide multiplicity will have a significant effect on the number of habitable planets in the Galaxy. We propose to test the disruption of planetary systems caused by a wide companion proposed by Kaib et al. (2013).  In this theory, wide companions interact with field stars and are sent into elliptical orbits bringing them close to their primary star, possibly close enough to disrupt a planetary system. This could eject planets from the system or provide an instigator for migration, moving giant planets closer to their parent star. Over the course of the next two years we will target approximately 1000 stars across the 10 K2 fields yielding approximately 20 planets. This will allow us to measure the occurrence of short period planets around stars in wide binaries and to test whether this deviates significantly from the field population. This will constrain the potential systematic bias on planet occurrence rates caused by multiplicity.Kepler has already been used to accurately measure the rotation periods of thousands of stars.

 
 
Science Goal 2: Provide benchmark gyrochronology systems. Wide binary systems contain stars which are physically isolated from each other yet share common metallicity and age. This means that the stars in these systems can be used to test age relations, which should give similar ages for both components.

 
 
By including wide binary components as Kepler targets, we will produce a valuable legacy product to test and recalibrate gyrochronology relations allowing the ages of field stars to be better constrained.

 
Target Selection. We will use the proper motion catalogue produced by Kraus et al. (2014) based on the methods of Kraus & Hillenbrand (2007) including proper motions, estimated spectral types and distance moduli from SED fitting. We will select objects with significant (>5sigma) proper motions above 30mas/yr. From these we will select pairs of widely separated objects with common proper motion and distance.  To remove contamination due to coincident pairings of unrelated field stars, we will plot a histogram similar to the one we constructed for field 6 of pair separation. From this we will select pairs which lie in the region dominated by true physical pairs."

Planets orbital, structural, and atmospheric properties can evolve through a range of processes, including gravitational interactions with other nearby planets or stars and high-energy radiation from their host star. K2 has offered a unique glimpse into these changes by enabling the discovery of transiting planets in nearby young clusters (Pleiades, Praesepe, and Hyades) and young stellar associations (e.g., Upper Scorpius) aged 11-800 Myr.

Planet parameters are inexorably linked to that of the host star. However, parameters of young and active stars are more difficult to determine than their old, inactive counterparts. Fortunately, K2 has provided precise light curves of young eclipsing binaries in the same clusters and associations. These light curves provide us with empirical constraints on host star parameters with the same abundances and ages as the corresponding young planet hosts.

Our understanding of both young planets and their hosts is limited by the fact that K2 observations of young clusters have been monochromatic, long cadence, and could not be done simultaneously from the ground. Short duration transits, which are common for close-in planets around late-type stars, are often unresolved or poorly resolved in long cadence data, resulting in poorer transit parameters. Further, when a transiting planet or eclipsing star crosses a spot, the amount of light blocked is decreased, deforming the transit and biasing the resulting parameters. Spot-crossings can be identified in the K2 long cadence data through asymmetries, but are too poorly resolved to remove or study in detail. Multi-wavelength data could be used to study the spot, but it would need to be simultaneous with the K2 observations.

Here we request short cadence data on the known Praesepe planets and eclipsing binaries in the Campaign 16 field. Short cadence data will provide better measurements of the transit duration and hence planet's eccentricity, a probe of its dynamical state. Additional observations can identify any longer-period planets directly or through the measurement of transit timing variations. Higher cadence also will enable us to resolve out spot crossings and correct for any resulting distortion. Because Campaign 16 is forward-facing, we can take multi-wavelength, simultaneous, ground-based photometry, from which we can measure the color (temperature) of the spot. This would provide a unique view of spot properties outside our Sun. Thus Campaign 16 presents a powerful opportunity to vastly improve our understanding of planets and their hosts at 800 Myr."

Long Baseline TTV mass determinations with K2","Science Goals Objectives:  Transit-timing variations, or TTVs, have been an incredible tool to accurately measure the masses of many planet systems in the Kepler Mission.  However, K2 has not been able to capitalize on the precision of TTV measurements in part due to the much shorter baseline of data in its ~90 day campaigns.  In C16, we have the unique opportunity to investigate a sample of known exoplanet candidates that were found in C5 using K2, 3 years ago due to an overlap of the observing fields.  Fortuitously, a few of the candidates are known to belong to a multiple planet system and this number may increase in C16 due to the longer observing baseline.  Of the known multis, any detected TTVs over the 3 year baseline will enable mass constraints even if the planetary masses are too low for an RV detection.  TTV measurements are important because they help constrain the observational ephemerides allowing for tractable photometric follow-up studies and space-based observations focused on atmospheric characterization (e.g., JWST).  They also have been an exceptional probe of planet densities using Kepler and much more so with K2 as the targets tend to be much brighter, which permits an independent measure of the mass through ground-based follow-up RV observations.  These are just two types of science that benefit from TTV measurements, which can improve the accuracy of characterized planetary systems.  We seek to observe, in C16, the exoplanet candidates discovered by Pope, Parviainen, & Aigrain (2016) in C5 in order to more accurately measure their transit times and take advantage of a 3 year observation gap utilizing the immense power of TTVs to measure the masses of these exoplanets and potentially discover more many-body systems.

Methodology: The method of TTVs has uncovered a distinct population within exoplanet studies, namely those of lower density.  Our team has extensive knowledge and experience with Kepler/K2 photometric data for both transit finding and analysis.  We have a target list of exoplanet candidates (previously observed in C5) that may have undetected transiting neighbors or have detectable perturbations from previously unknown neighbors.  Observations from C16 will help us determine if this is the case and improve the characterization of these targets.  Furthermore, we will better understand our search capabilities with a transit injection study.  These studies are important to match archival observations with  future observations with TESS as those data will consist of similar short campaigns.  Relevance to Kepler-GO Program: Using observations with K2, we will search for additional exoplanets and better characterize a set of exoplanet candidates uncovered from a previous K2 campaign.  Our research will broadly further the science goals of the Kepler mission, identifying exoplanet candidates and providing better characterization in the transit parameters of the already known candidates.  Detections of additional planets within our target sample may become part of a set of high-profile targets for atmospheric transmission with JWST and will be unique to K2, as the observing strategy for TESS avoids the ecliptic."

Monitoring of these galaxies will allow us to look for fast (t > 10 day) and faint (M < -15) stellar transients. The K2 science mission, with its long baseline, high-cadence, good light-gathering power allows us to obtain high precision photometry. The ability to monitor several targets simultaneously provides a unique opportunity to examine such a broad range of variables and transients.  The fast transients we wish to examine are defined by their fainter than SNe (Mv < -16) magnitudes, fast rise times and/or short lifetime. Perets et al. 2010 found a new class of faint events that were spectroscopically similar to SN Ib/c but had strong calcium lines in their nebular spectra. These objects characterized by a relatively fast light curve (12 - 15 days), making them difficult to find by traditional surveys, and thus the progenitors of these interesting events are unknown  In addition, Drout et al. 2014, using the Pan-STARRS1 survey, found a few transients that were relatively bright (-16 < M < -20) but with a time near maximum of only a few days. Even though they are bright, their short time scale, some brightening in only a day, means these events are usually missed. The stellar origin of these events is also unknown. PTF has been a prolific discoverer of unique short-lived and/or faint events as well.  This program will also be sensitive to LBV- and nova-like eruptions, large amplitude flare stars, cataclysmic variable stars, and other still unknown types of faint, fast transients.  We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe these galaxies every other day using SkyMapper and ATLAS Pathfinder. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify the transients using PESSTO, and existing programs at Siding Spring, Lick, Gemini, and Keck"

We propose a Large K2 Program to monitor on the order of 10,000 bright galaxies in each of Campaign C14, C15, and C16, which should yield in total more than 15 great light curves (LCs) of supernovae. In Kepler GO programs, we have identified to date 3 SN Ia (Olling et al. 2015), 2 SN IIP (Garnavich et al. 2016; Tucker et al., submitted), and 1 SN IIn/Ia-csm (Garnavich et al., in prep.). We also found that ~4% of our galaxies display AGN activity with variability at >0.001% level (Shaya et al 2015). In K2 Campaign C3, C5, C6, C8, and C10 we identified more than 15 SNe, three of which we spectroscopically classified. Analysis of the K2 data is ongoing.  With our program, we plan to a) determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe using features in the early breakout (t < 4 days) LCs; b) explore the explosion physics of SN, especially SN Ia, using subtle features during their rise (t < 20 days); c) improve the calibration of SN Ia as standard candles for measuring distances, Ho, and dark energy using K2 LCs of unprecedented detail; and d) add significant knowledge to the virtually unexplored very low-Eddington regime of AGN.  There is an ongoing controversy over the basic physics of one of the key tools in cosmology, the SN Ia standard candle. Do SNe Ia gradually reach critical mass via accretion from a companion star or does it merge with another WD? If a white dwarf had been accreting mass from a companion star, as the ejecta reaches the companion a shock would form with observable optical emission (Kasen 2010). The emission would be short and strongest from certain viewing angles, requiring rapid cadence for several SNe before definitive conclusions can be reached. For the 3 SN Ia discovered by Kepler monitoring of ~500 galaxies (Olling et al. 2015), no signatures of a companion were found and tight constraints were placed. With a larger sample, we can determine the statistics for the two possible channels that trigger SN Ia. Meanwhile, features due to the different explosion physics (detonation, deflagration, inwards-moving diffusion waves, etc) of Ia and core collapse SNe will also be revealed. K2 will allow for the first time to test models more complicated than simple ""expanding fireballs.""  We will undertake a major, concurrent ground-based effort to observe the entire field every other day using SkyMapper, ATLAS and DECam. We will also coordinate multi-color photometry and spectra to classify discovered transients using Lick, Gemini, and Keck. In Campaign C5 and C6, we successfully identified 4 SNe with DECam observations, of which we classified 2 with Gemini spectra as SN Ia. These data, coupled with high precision 30 minute K2 data will have enormous legacy value.  Methods: 
We have developed and proven a highly successful detrending method that simultaneously solves for the sawtooth pattern caused by pointing motion and for the coefficients of vectors from principal component analysis of targets on the same channel. This iterative technique permits us to define aperture sizes better suited to this problem and to make excellent corrections for sensitivity variations on all time scales. To properly correct SN light curves, the technique is applied to the quiet time before the event and then extrapolated to the end of the campaign.  References:

These cores are at the centers of all horizontal branch stars so understanding them has impact across much of astronomy. Our understanding comes from applying seismic constraints from their pulsations to stellar models which contain appropriate physics. Only Kepler (K1) and K2 observations have proven sufficient to interpret their pulsations (even TESS will not contribute). So campaigns 14 to 16 are our last chance to accumulate observational data. Pulsating horizontal branch cores are sdBV stars. K1 discovered 19 and K2 (to C8) has discovered 18 and observed 2 known sdBV stars. Through several years experience, we have made great progress, with several analyses ongoing. We have learned to robustly assign pulsation modes using asymptotic period spacings, rotationally split multiplets, and the value of the Ledoux constant. These supply extremely strong constraints to structural models, which prior to K1 were under-constrained, but now demonstrate contradictions between observation and theory. This implies that the models require new physics, especially regarding the physics of diffusion and tides, and will lead to a better understanding of stellar structure.
 We anticipated degeneracies between core mass, envelope mass, and evolution, requiring multiple stars to overcome. From K1, and continuing with K2, we have found that core masses in sdBV stars have a narrow range. We have uncovered new features including: stars with differential and others with uniform rotation; stars with stable pulsations and others with stochastic properties; frequency multiplets which we associate with stellar rotation that are constant, converging, or diverging; pulsations in only pressure (surface) modes, only gravity (core-sensing) modes, and both (hybrids); varying degrees of mode trapping, which is a consequence of  internal stratification; and rotation rates which are long, sub-synchronous when in binaries, yet we are discovering groupings, likely related to mass loss/exchange mechanisms.To discriminate the causes of these various features will require substantial modelling efforts, but those can only proceed with observational constraints. As such, we still urgently need K2 observations of sdBV stars covering the full range of pulsation properties, especially in the pressure-mode domain, which is very sparsely populated by K1+K2 observations.
 Our team has extensively explored many aspects of sdB stars, including spectroscopic characterisation, binary properties, and the application of asteroseismic tools. We have been examining sdB stars since their pulsations were discovered in 1996 and have already published over 20 papers from K1 and five from K2.
 We propose to observe about 5-8 stars per campaign, most of which are so far unobserved for pulsations. We only select the most promising targets, both in terms of potential pulsation and binary properties. Processes we can probe include radiative and gravitational diffusion; binary interaction, mass and
angular momentum exchange; post-helium flash core structure; and helium fusion cross-sections via evolution.
 We also include students in our work. Many of our papers include undergraduate students as significant contributors. Students have learned to process, analyze, and interpret K2 data for pulsations and binarity. They have also been involved in pre- and post-Kepler characterisation studies, providing them with a broad range of training. Graduate students at European partner institutions will be working with us; processing and interpreting pulsations, as well as developing new physics for sdB star models as part of their thesis work. Only K2 provides sufficient accuracy, duty cycle, and duration necessary to fully exploit sdB pulsations as a probe of stellar astrophysics."
GO16081,16,Joyce,Ann,Guzik,Los Alamos National Laboratory,joy@lanl.gov,"Jackiewicz, Jason; Gaulme, Patrick",Variability of Stellar Analogs to F3 V Stars theta Cyg and KIC 8462852,"We propose to observe in short cadence several bright main-sequence stars of mid-F spectral type in each of K2 Campaigns 14, 15, and 16.  theta Cyg was the brightest star observed by the original Kepler mission (visual magnitude 4.5), and was observed in short cadence using a custom mask during Quarters 8 and 12-17 (Guzik et al. 2016, ApJ 831, 17 ).  With effective temperature 6697 ± 78 K (spectroscopy), mass 1.39 solar masses (asteroseismology) and radius 1.49 solar radii (interferometry), theta Cyg was expected from pulsation models to show gamma Doradus-type g-mode pulsations with periods of order one day, but no g modes were detected.  However, theta Cyg does exhibit stochastically excited solar-like oscillations with frequency of maximum amplitude 1829 µHz that were used for asteroseismic modeling.

KIC 8462852 (a.k.a. Tabby's star) was observed by Kepler for 16 quarters, however, only in long cadence.  Spectroscopic observations place this star at effective temperature 6750 ± 120 K, with an estimated mass 1.43 solar masses and radius 1.58 solar radii (Boyajian et al. 2016, MNRAS 457, 3988).   KIC 8462852 shows a prominent small-amplitude period of 0.88 day that is probably related to rotation, as well as a longer period (10-20 day) brightness variation.  This star notably shows irregular mysterious flux decreases of up to 20 percent lasting 5 to 80 days, as well as a slow brightness decrease of about a percent throughout the Kepler mission. The causes of these unusual brightness changes are under investigation(Boyajian et al. 2016; Montet and Simon 2016, ApJL 830, L39; Wright and Sigurdssen 2016, ApJL, 829, L3).  Although external causes such as eclipses by comet swarms are a leading explanation, intrinsic stellar brightness variations by an unknown mechanism have not been entirely ruled out.  An asteroseismic analysis of KIC 87462852 cannot be carried out (yet) because of the lack of short-cadence observations that may have revealed solar-like oscillations such as those found in theta Cyg.

We expect that short-cadence K2 observations of relatively bright mid-F main-sequence stars will provide additional pulsating targets for detailed asteroseismic modeling.  Finding stars that exhibit both solar-like observations and gamma Dor g-mode or even delta Sct-like p-mode oscillations would provide constraints on stellar properties, age, and pulsation driving mechanisms.  There may exist analogs of theta Cyg or KIC 8462852 in the Kepler and K2 data archives observed in short cadence, although the Kepler targets are likely to be less bright or have shorter time-series observations than theta Cyg or KIC 8462852.  Solar-like oscillations were first characterized with a partial quarter of Kepler data for theta Cyg, and they have also been measured in short-cadence K2 data (e.g., Lund et al. 2016, MNRAS 463, 200).  The generally higher-amplitude gamma Dor and delta Sct pulsations should be detectable, if they exist.  Perhaps asteroseismic modeling of additional F3 V spectral-type stars will provide clues to the strange photometric variations of KIC 8462852, or at least help to rule out intrinsic brightness variations.  It is even possible that stars with similar anomalous brightness variations may be discovered.  Further observations of such stars would help to define and explain the transition region between solar-like and gamma Doradus pulsators on the main sequence.

Our small-proposal budget request is $20 K for the PI to execute the project.  The possibility exists to leverage support via the New Mexico Consortium for a student shared between the PI institution and New Mexico State University."

Due to their low luminosity, their habitable zones (HZ) lie very close to the star (within ~0.2 AU). They are thus prime targets in the search for habitable worlds because planets in their HZ induce deep transits and high-amplitude radial velocities compared to planets in the HZ of Sun-like stars. A long debate has ensued on whether they could be habitable. A primary complication is that M-dwarfs remain magnetically active, exhibiting a high rate of strong stellar flares, for billions of years. There are predictions that a combination of flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and energetic particles from an active M-dwarf could render a planet uninhabitable. However, these predictions rely on extrapolating observations of the Sun's radiation environment by orders of magnitude to model events on active M-dwarfs. To test whether the magnetic activity from M-dwarfs are consistent with solar correlations or if they require new relationships,we propose to observe four M-dwarf flare stars with K2 short cadence data and supplement these observations with simultaneous ground-based radio observations. Radio spectroscopy surveys offer the potential to detect CMEs and stellar energetic particles. These simultaneous observations will allow us to measure the relationship between CME kinetic energy, energetic particle flux, and optical flare energy for radio bursts that are associated with flares. Additionally, simultaneous K2 optical data can help distinguish between different radio emission mechanisms by looking for radio bursts drifting in frequency shortly after large optical flares. The study of stellar coherent radio bursts is still at an exploratory stage, but it promises to be a unique way of detecting stellar space weather events. This research has direct implications to exoplanet habitability because the first places we will search for life on an exoplanet will be a cool star.

Our primary target is Wolf 359; a star well-studied in science fact and fiction that is amongst our nearest stellar neighbors. At a distance of just 2.4 pc, this mid-M dwarf provides an ideal laboratory to research the physical processes of the coolest stars. We also propose three other targets: AZ Cnc is an M6.5 star whose flaring behavior has been well studied; DP Cnc and CS Cnc are bright early M-dwarfs that were observed by K2 in C5 and show large but unresolved flares in the long cadence data collected."

GO16085,16,Erin,Lee,Ryan,SETI Institute,erinleeryan@gmail.com,"Woodward, Charles E.",K2's Keys to the Solar System: Tracing Planetary Migration with Asteroid Lightcurves,"Studies of the small bodies of the solar system reveal important clues about the condensation and formation of planetesimal bodies, and ultimately planets in planetary systems. Dynamics of small bodies have been utilized to model giant planet migration within our solar system, colors have been used to explore compositional gradients within the protoplanetary disk, & studies of the size-frequency distribution of main belt asteroids may reveal compositional dependences on planetesimal strength limiting models of planetary growth from collisional aggregration. Studies of the optical lightcurves of asteroids also yield important information on shape and potential binarity of asteroidal bodies.  Lightcurves of Hilda and Trojan asteroids populations yield key information about the primordial shape and binary fraction of these small body populations and their origins. Milli-mag Kepler photometry will tightly constrain both of the latter characteristics. These 2 populations are in resonances with Jupiter & collisional frequencies within these populations are the lowest within inner solar system small body populations . Results from the WISE survey suggest that ~20% of Trojans & ~40% of Hildas are either extremely elongated objects or binaries, however preliminary results from our Kepler GO2-GO3 suggest a higher binary fraction within the Trojans and lower within the Hildas.  Ground based surveys are not optimal for this type of photometric variability study due to large amounts of observing time required (approximately 4 to 5 nights per object on a 2-m class telescope) & nightly aliasing effects on lightcurves. Kepler however is ideal for this type of photometric survey of asteroid variability due to the photometric stability of the observing platform and the correspondence between the C14 & C16 fields and the L5 Trojan cloud.

The science objectives of this program are as follows: 
Objective 1: Measure the lightcurve amplitude for ~ 90 Hildas and Trojans for comparison with the Scattered Kuiper Belt population 
Objective 2: Determine binary fraction of Hildas and Trojans via lightcurve transits and compare to results from the Kuiper Belt & WISE  Methodology: We have identified 89 objects for study in the Hilda and Trojan asteroids to be studied with Kepler in C14-16 with magnitudes of m_V < 21. Due to the overlap between the Campaign 14 field and the L5 Trojan cloud, our request for data represents 56 objects Campaign 14 (30 Hildas, 26 Trojans), 25 objects in Campaign 15 ( 21 Hildas and 4 Trojans) & 8 L4 Trojans in Campaign 16. These objects are not stationary within the Kepler fields, rather they move across the field, resulting in a mean time in the Kepler field of view on active silicon of 24 days. Due to the motion of these targets, the Kepler Science Center assesses solar system program as containing more targets than proposed number of objects, (In C11, our program with 70 solar system targets was assessed 17118 Kepler target masks), thus THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A LARGE PROPOSAL. We will utilize data obtained with the 30 minute Kepler cadence to determine rotational periods for our selected targets. The ratio of lightcurve amplitudes will subsequently be utilized to determine body elongation and/or binarity to address objectives 1&2.  Relevance to K2: 
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 14-16 to determine if these objects originated in the Kuiper Belt and later migrated and are amenable to the operational characteristics and constraints of the mission and defined observing fields."
GO16086,16,Erin,Lee,Ryan,SETI Institute,erinleeryan@gmail.com,"Woodward, Charles E.; Lisse, Carey M.",K2's Keys to the Solar System: Studies of Cometary Nuclei,"Due to their outgassing, comets are some of the best samples of the protoplanetary disk material present in the early solar system. This outgassing however presents challenges to characterizing comet nuclei in terms of surface color and rotational period which are utilized to characterize their asteroid siblings. At periods wherein comets appear the brightest, their flux is dominated by gas and dust in the coma, leaving the best observational circumstances for cometary nuclei when these objects are at distances > ~3 AU beyond which sublimation of water ice does not drive the cometary coma.  Lightcurves have been utilized to estimate the limits bulk density and approximate shapes and/or axial ratios of cometary nuclei for only a small handful of the known comet population.  In many cases rotational periods of comets are poorly constrained due to incomplete ground based telescopic data over the fitted period. This results in both errors in estimates of the axial ratios and the rotational periods for the observed comet nuclei.  We propose to utilize K2 to obtain lightcurves for 11 comets in GO-5 to :
* Determine the rotational periods and amplitudes for a sample of comets at heliocentric distances > 3 AU which will be compared to other bodies such as Trojan and Hilda asteroids, as well as Kuiper Belt Objects
* Compare lightcurve periods to those published in the literature for a subsample of short period comets to determine if the rotational period of these cometary nuclei has been altered by outgassing activity Methodology:
We have identified 11 comets to be studied by Kepler in Campaigns 14-16 with magnitudes of m_V < 21. The single observation photometric uncertainty for objects of 21st magnitude observed with the 30 minute cadence of K2 is 0.15 magnitudes, sufficient to identify objects with axis ratios >= 1.15. Two comets within our sample have published rotational periods and have undergone an additional perihelion passage, allowing us to determine if the rotational period has been modified.

Relevance to K2: 
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 14-16 to determine if these objects have lightcurve periods and amplitudes common to specific asteroid populations consistent with a common origin in the early solar system. Our sample is only comprised of objects within the K2 fields, and thus does not require any modifications from the reported operational characteristics of the spacecraft during these campaigns."
GO16088,16,Gordon,T,Richards,Drexel University,gtr@physics.drexel.edu,"Kasliwal, Vishal Pramod; Vogeley, Michael S.",Quasar Variability as a Function of Accretion Rate,"Active Galactic Nuclei are known to exhibit rapid, high-amplitude flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Variability in the optical is observed at the 10% level in 99% of quasars. The cause of quasar variability is not known, but current theories suggest that the variations may be attributable to a combination of small-scale variations in the accretion disk viscosity that are triggered by localized dynamo processes, accretion disk instabilities, large scale fueling-rate variations, and complex oscillations of the accretion disk. Optical variability may be driven by X-ray variability which itself may be generated by flares in the accretion disk. Physical mechanisms for variability introduce causal correlation into the light curves of quasars i.e. it may be possible to probe the physical drivers of quasar variability by studying the correlation structure of their light curves.

One of the challenges in understanding the physics of quasar variability is that, while one can compute an average quasar spectral energy distribution, there is no ""standard"" quasar. The diversity of quasars is seen in their radio and X-ray continuum and UV emission lines and can be characterized by the mass-weighted accretion rate or Eddington ratio (L/LEdd). Exploring quasar variability as a function of that diversity is the focus of this work.

We will explore the amplitude/timescale of short-time variability as determined by Kepler---as a function of those quasar properties that exhibit the largest dispersion (and thus represent quasar extrema). The goal being to try to understand if quasars at opposite extremes have different short time variability that is manifested in the Kepler data and can constrain quasar physics. There are nearly 20,000 known quasars in the Campaign 14, 15, and 16 fields for which such an investigation can be conducted.  We propose to observe 2128 of the brightest targets.

We will further compare the amplitude/timescale of short-time variability as determined by Kepler to the long-time variability as determined by SDSS (and the combination of SDSS and Kepler). Here we will compare the variability to the expected variability from a Damped Random Walk (which is the same at both short and long timescale) and to a CARMA model (which can be different at short and long timescales). Again, the goal is to constrain quasar accretion physics.

Bright objects (i<~19.25, which amounts to about 12% of the samples) can be studied individually. Fainter objects can contribute to this work through stacking analysis.  Specifically, we will group the quasars by like UV (also radio and X-ray) properties and treat the light curves from them as the light curve from a single mean source.

Without a better understanding of differences in quasar variability across the diversity of quasar emission line properties, we will not be able to fully understand the physics of quasar variability. The combination of known SDSS quasars with new K2 data makes for an incredibly powerful tool for AGN variability analysis."

Many sdBs are known to have close companions with periods ranging from 0.05 to 10 days, and must have evolved through the common-envelope-ejection (CEE) process. The closest systems are quite easy to study from the ground, but Kepler observations have opened the door for precise studies of the population of systems with periods between 0.5 and and 10 days.  Several close binary sdB stars were discovered by the original Kepler mission. The excellent Kepler light curves show photometric signals from Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal deformations and mutual irradiation effects. Long-cadence K2 observations presents us with an unique opportunity to accumulate a larger sample of post-common envelope sdB binaries that can shed light on the statistics of the CEE process, and thereby constrain the long sought after efficiency parameters that govern the common envelope stage of evolution. In the process we hope to find new particularly interesting binary systems, such as the eclipsing cases and those with extraordinary masses that could be progenitors of type-Ia supernovae."
GO16091,16,Ruth,,Peterson,SETI Institute,peterson@ucolick.org,"Montalban, Josefina",The Evolutionary History of the Blue Horizontal Branch Star HD 74721,"Relevance of K2 data for HD 74721.

We propose long-cadence (LC) Kepler 2 light curves of HD 74721 in the forward-facing Campaign 16. HD 74721 is a bright (Kp=9.64), well-studied field blue horizontal branch (BHB) star. Recent analyses of UVES optical and STIS E230M UV echelle spectra provide an effective temperature Teff ~ 9000K and a metallicity [Fe/H] ~ -1 (one-tenth solar), unusually metal-rich for a BHB star. Its rotational velocity is < 5 km/s, unusually slow for a hot star.  Although its radial velocities show little variability, HD 74721 is likely to be a binary that has undergone mass transfer to a companion. Single-star evolutionary tracks require either a high helium abundance or significant mass loss to produce BHB stars of this metallicity. Further mass loss is believed to yield the hotter extreme blue horizontal branch (EHB) stars, which are seen in old, massive, red, inactive galaxies at even higher metallicities.

The proposed K2 data will be the first Kepler light curve of an isolated, bright, core-helium-burning star on the cool half of the blue horizontal branch. It will provide a legacy, and perhaps a surprise; the surface rotation of BHB stars was only discovered once first targeted for high-resolution spectroscopy. A few K2 light curves were obtained for BHB stars in the globular cluster M4 (of similar metallicity), but these are faint and crowded. HD 74721 is likely too hot for solar-like oscillations, and too cool for EHB oscillations. Its K2 data should reveal its binary nature, and might also show phenomena seen in more massive hot stars. These include semi-periodic variations with periods of a few to several tens of days, which are seen in Kepler data of several objects of similar temperature at levels from a few tenths of a percent to a few percent, or oscillations or spots.  Goals.

From K2 data, we should be able to establish whether HD 74721 is in a merging binary system, or in one whose companions have already merged and was then spun down by mass lost to a disk. We plan to derive constraints on its He content, its radial-velocity behavior, and its current mass loss from high-resolution spectra to be proposed for the same time frame, which can then be related directly to the simultaneous light curve variations. By identifying and characterizing the nature of this star, we hope to infer its previous and future evolutionary history. A better understanding of the circumstances under which a star of one-tenth solar metallicity or higher becomes a BHB/EHB star should greatly aid the interpretation of the outer Galactic halo, and the age and metallicity of luminous, old, evolved galaxies.

Methods.

The K2 light curves will be corrected for roll angle variation following one or more of the published approaches suitable for this isolated star. Further analysis will depend on the phenomena observed. We will seek the guidance of other colleagues with the relevant expertise where desirable.

Additional high-resolution spectroscopy during C16 will be sought by proposals to relevant institutions. On the ground, the star is bright enough for the OHP Sophie echelle spectrograph on the 2m telescope. In space, we will propose in HST Cycle 25 for HD 74721 STIS E230H spectra, since the many strong UV resonance lines are more sensitive to mass loss than is Ca II. These will require substantially fewer orbits than Peterson, Spite, and Barbuy received for E230H spectra of metal-poor stars in Cycle 24 (GO-14672). Existing UV spectra of HD 74721 show blue-shifted cores of strong resonance lines.

At the velocity of HD 74721, +31 km/s, the line core blueshifts are superimposed on absorption by the interstellar medium (ISM). These can be distinguished since the ISM velocity is constant, but the stellar outflow may vary. Because the orbital phase will be known for each spectrum, the relative velocity of any stellar outflow can be explicitly tracked against the stellar orbital velocity."
GO16094,16,Greg,,Aldering,Lawrence Berkeley National Lab,galdering@lbl.gov,"Gupta, Ravi Ryan; Copin, Yannick; Nordin, Jakob; Perlmutter, Saul; Rubin, David; Boone, Kyle Robert; Hayden, Brian; Smadja, Gerard",Spectrophotometric Time Series for the Kepler-2 Supernova Experiment,"Campaign 16 of Kepler Cycle 5 will monitor 20,000 galaxies in anticipation that many of these galaxies will host supernovae while being monitored by Kepler.  The science yield of the Kepler-2 Supernova Experiment (K2SE) can be greatly enhanced through ground-based spectrophometric time series.  The SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) is uniquely suited for this task.

Emission from shocked gas at the earliest phases due, e.g., to interactions with a companion, is one of the most unique set of measurements that the K2SE will provide. But such shocks have characteristics that can't be uniquely constrained by the single-band optical photometry provided by Kepler. Sited on Mauna Kea, SNIFS can work as blue as the atmospheric ozone limit, providing the UV data and spectral information essential for confirming the presence of shocked gas.

With it's single band, Kepler will not be able to determine the SN Ia colors that are needed to correct for dust extinction and luminosity standardization. Moreover, spectrophotometry is necessary to provide the K-corrections needed to put the Kepler SNe on a uniform system. Without K-corrections for each phase, the implied advantages from space-based photometry will be greatly weakened.  SNIFS can provide color and K-correction information well beyond the 0.43-0.89 micron coverage of Kepler. The resulting K-corrections will be valuable for application to other SN Ia samples as well.

SNIFS has been used to demonstrate that SNe Ia whose spectrophotometric time series match - so called ""twins"" - can be standardized to an accuracy twice as good as that acheived using lightcurves from optical filter photometry. Besides the resulting boost in distance accuracy, this improvement implicitly removes about 75% of the astrophysical and dust property differences between SNe Ia. This is a huge improvement in systematics control that will be essential for helping K2SE improve cosmology measurements using SNe Ia.

Equally important is consistent flux calibration between the K2SE subset and SNe at higher redshift. Conventional imaging photometry requires that the system transmission be scanned on a regular basis, otherwise the measurements will suffer from unknown ""S-corrections,"" but in practice this is not done. Unknown S-corrections have the same ruinous effects as unknown K-corrections. Since SNIFS is spectrophotometric, it can tie the K2SE SNe directly to the HST CALSPEC fundamental standard stars and SNLS and SDSS tertiary stars. While other spectrographs could observe spectrophotometric standards and K2SE SNe, SNIFS is the only spectroscopic instrument that has demonstrated the accurate calibration and host galaxy subtraction necessary for cosmology applications.

We envision pooling the equivalent of approximately 40 queue-scheduled nights to obtain spectrophotometric time series for the ~40 SNe Ia with z < 0.08 and full phase coverage expected from the Campaign 16 supernova fields. This will allow observations with a cadence of ~2 days when the SNe are on the rise, and 3-10 day sampling on the decline. The focus on SNe~Ia with z < 0.08 ensures that SNIFS will be able to detect shocked gas from interaction with a companion. These spectrophotometric time series will provide accurate subtraction of host-galaxy light, K-corrections, will be free of S-corrections, and will be calibrated on a reliable flux system. Twinning with the sample of 200+ SNe Ia having spectrophotometric time series already taken with SNIFS will allow the twin SN technique to be applied, thereby providing the best standardization of the K2SE SN Ia dataset.

This effort will be coordinated with the other programs accepted under this AO, which will be organized at the February community meeting on the Kepler-2 Supernova Experiment.  Our spectrophotometric time series will be an essential value-added accompaniment to the K2SE observations."

ZTF adds a new 47 sq. deg. Field-of-View camera with fast read-out electronics to the updated Samuel Oschin 48-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory. ZTF is designed to find young and rare optical transients, and will be capable of scanning more than 3750 sq. degrees each hour. ZTF is on track for commissioning next spring and summer. Fall 2017 is focused on building references and training the machine-learning algorithms in rejecting false candidates.

The combination of a depth similar to Kepler (21st mag), an IPAC search pipeline which builds on the successful PTF and iPTF surveys and dedicated spectroscopic resources for classification allows ZTF to find transients in the Kepler fields early enough to trigger the extensive additional observations that are needed to fully utilize Kepler lightcurves. Necessary additional steps to realize this includes: Prioritizing Kepler fields in reference building and scheduling, guaranteeing sufficient scanning and spectroscopic resources and providing classified candidates to the community."
GO16096,16,Cole,,Johnston,KU Leuven,colecampbell.johnston@kuleuven.be,"Aerts, Conny Clara",SAMPLINg: Searching for low AMPlitude puLsatIoNs in hot sud-dwarf OB stars,"The existence of hot, compact, core helium burning sub-dwarf O and B (sdOB) objects is currently thought to be explained through different channels of binary evolution, which results in the stripping of the hydrogen envelope of an evolving star near the onset of core helium burning. The resulting population of sdOB stars consists of apparently single (merger) and both close (Common Envelope) and wide (stable Roche Lobe Over Flow) binary systems. Currently, the formation of those close binary systems is explained through competing, and poorly constrained, physical descriptions of the common-envelope phase of evolution. As they are directly the result of common-envelope evolution, the properties of close binary sdOB stars are highly sensitive to the mechanics of this phase of evolution. Additionally, sdOB stars are observed to exhibit both pressure (p-) and gravity (g-) mode pulsations, making them ideal targets for detailed seismic modeling, which enables precise and independent determination of the stellar parameters sensitive to the physics of their formation. 
Unfortunately, these objects are both rare and relatively faint. As a result, only a handful had been observed with the nominal Kepler mission, which had a stationary observing field. Furthermore, only a select few of those have had their rich pulsation spectrum exploited for seismic modeling. Most regrettably, Kepler did not observe any of the hottest sdOB pulsators exhibiting p-modes. Their interior structure could therefore not be tuned from space asteroseismology and compared with the one of the cooler g-mode sdB pulsators. Here, we plan to remedy this situation. We propose 19 objects for observation with K2 to search for pulsations for follow-up ground based observations with the MAIA multicolor photometer.
The high precision, quasi-uninterrupted observations provided only by K2 are essential for our science goals aimed at the detailed study of low amplitude compact pulsators such as sdOB stars. Moreover, the high quality data allows for the accurate detection and characterization of pulsations down to the milli-magnitude level, as well as the accurate subtraction of any binary signal present in the lightcurve. Finally, while the nominal Kepler mission saw success with sdOB stars, these observations will serve as a proof of concept for the highly anticipated TESS mission, which is restricted to shorter observing campaigns as is the K2 mission. 
The team present at the host institute of the PI has the experience and means to effectively and efficiently exploit the data provided by the K2 mission. Using these K2 data, we aim to search for pulsations in the proposed targets, and if detected use them to investigate the interior structure of these targets with detailed seismic modeling. The methodology we will employ hinges upon what type of signal is present. If binarity is detectable in the lightcurve, the methodology will consist of an iterative binary modeling and frequency analysis routine to as completely as possible model the binarity without the influence of any other signal, while simultaneously attempting to detect pulsations. If no binary signal is present in the lightcurve, we will proceed directly to the frequency analysis to search for pulsations. If pulsations are detected but cannot be identified with the K2 data, ground-based, multicolor observations will be obtained with MAIA, owned by the host institute, for mode identification of the dominant mode(s) and subsequent detailed seismic modeling synergistically using the MESA stellar modeling code and GYRE pulsation code.
	For two objects that fall within the theoretical p-mode instability strips, we request short-cadence observations as it is required to sample the high frequencies (+400 d-1) where pulsations are observed. Long-cadence observations are requested for the characterization of the remaining objects as potential binaries or g-mode pulsators to improve statistics on these objects."

These families include main belt asteroids (Szabo, R. et al., 2016), Trojans of Jupiter (Szabo, Gy. et al.), trans-Neptunian objects (Pal et al. 2015, 2016, AJ) as well as irregular satellites of giant planets (Kiss et al. 2016, Pal et al. 2016, DPS). The value and information extracted from these light curves can be incorporated as it is own in order to determine the rotation period and derive shape characteristics as well as these measurements can be combined with other types of data, mainly with the quantification of the thermal infrared emission (Muller et al. 2009). Beyond the determination these basic physical properties, we can have hints about the presence of a moon (Marton, Kiss & Muller, 2016), we can constrain the history and relation of natural satellites and trans-Neptunian objects (Pal et al. 2016, DPS) or can ask whether there is any object which spins faster than Haumea (Rabinowitz et al., 2006).

Throughout the campaigns of 14, 15 and 16, 10+25+16 trans-Neptunian objects and Centaurs fall on silicon. One of these, 2001 YH140 has already been observed by K2 (during Campaign 5). We note that more than the half of these objects (8+13+8, in total) are recent discoveries by Pan-STARRS.

Here we propose to observe 5+11+9 trans-Neptunian objects and a Quasi-Hilda comet candidate throughout K2 campaigns of 14, 15 and 16. From this set, two objects have thermal emission data. Similarly to our former proposals, we set up the target priorities according to the apparent brightness, the diversity of dynamical classes and the presence of far-infrared thermal measurements. This sample of ours include many recent Pan-STARRS discoveries for which further astrometric measurements are also valuable. Due to the large number of this total sample of relevant objects (including TNOs and Centaurs), we propose only the objects which are sufficiently bright (brighter than 22.5) and have a sufficiently long arch (i.e. longer than 30 days) on a single CCD output. However, we note that even fainter ones and objects which shorter arcs can well be measured using K2 long cadence data (see e.g. Pal et al. 2015).

Classical Be stars are rapid rotators of spectral type B and luminosity class V-III which have an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk. The disk often exhibits Balmer emission lines and an infrared excess fed by discrete mass loss events called outbursts. In spite of their high V sin i, rapid rotation alone cannot explain  the ejection episodes as most Be stars do not rotate at their critical rotation rates. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic observations have been analyzed to demonstrate short-term variations are rather common among early-type Be stars. The observed line profile variability (LPV) is characterized by moving bumps traveling from blue to red across the line profile on timescales ranging from minutes to a few days. Non-radial pulsations (NRP) have been proposed as an explanation of the LPV observed in hot stars. NRP produce LPV thanks to the combination of the Doppler displacement of stellar surface elements with their associated temperature variations due to the compression/expansion caused by the passage of waves through the photosphere. NRP could be the additional mechanism required for a rapidly rotating B star to become a Be star, that is to trigger the Be phenomenon by means of mass ejection(Rivinius et al. 1998).   Huat et al. (2009) found for the Be HD 49330 from CoRoT and ground-based spectroscopic data an increase in amplitude for g-modes and a decrease for p-modes just before an outburst. Neiner et al. (2012) discovered gravito-inertial modes in the Be star HD 51452. They found that the mode amplitudes were linked to the presence of mini outbursts. In general, hot Be stars display nonradial pressure pulsation modes, whereas cooler ones display gravity modes. Despite those empirical evidences, the physical processes responsible for the outbursts and mass loss in Be stars are still poorly understood. Dziembowski et al. (2007) showed that high-order g-modes driven by the kappa mechanism are unstable in the region of the HR diagram occupied by Be stars. The predicted radial velocity amplitude due to an l=3 g-mode is ~ 20 km/s for a star with 4 solar masses, with pulsation periods in the range ~0.5 - 1.1 days. For more massive and hotter stars like HD 171219, unstable modes are found with periods of 0.5-2 days.  Pulsation analysis of a star requires the measurement of frequencies with both high photometric precision and high time-frequency resolution. Only space missions provide both conditions. Since NRP in Be stars have periods near 1.0 cycles per day, Kepler observations are especially important to avoid the frequency aliases due to the day/night cycle of ground observations. Another advantage of Kepler data is the continuous observations for months with a 30 min cadence that improves the chances to observe outburst events in our targets. Stellar seismology made a great leap forward thanks to the MOST, CoRoT and Kepler satellites. We chose targets in the K2 cycle 5 fields from those already discovered as well as new targets identified by ground photometry and spectroscopy made in the present year. Our targets have Kp between 7 and 14. Long cadence (30 min) is desirable for this research. We aim to have both Kepler photometric time-series and simultaneous ground spectroscopic observations (when possible) to measure Be periodicities and understand the Be phenomenon. Our proposal fits the Small category, with 20 targets in total. Our group have experience with asteroseismology and have already worked in the same analysis with CoRoT and K2 data (cycles 3 and 4).

Be stars, as easy-to-observe objects giving a privileged peek into the structure of rapidly rotating stars, are therefore among the best suited laboratories to investigate important problems in contemporary astrophysics, like the effects of rapid rotation on stellar evolution."

In combination, we will follow every K2 supernova in 13 bands (uBVgrRiIzyYJH).  The different sites allow for both improved cadence (being at different longitudes) and mitigates against poor weather at a single site.  Moreover, the Pan-STARRS and Swope telescopes are particularly well-calibrated.  The Pan-STARRS telescope was used to discover and monitor ~5000 high-z supernovae and is currently used for the low-z Foundation survey.  The Swope telescope was used for the Carnegie Supernova Project, which has also observed hundreds of supernovae.  Observations on these well-calibrated systems will directly link the K2 supernovae to a thousands of other supernovae observed on these systems.

Our program has three main goals.  First, we will provide the best distances to Type Ia supernovae.  This will allow us to improve Kepler measurements of important physical parameters such as radii of the progenitor stars.  It will also allow us to look for subtle correlations between the K2 light curves and Hubble residuals.

Second, we will use the K2 Type Ia supernovae as a ""Rosetta"" sample, anchored to the Pan-STARRS system.  As the K2 supernovae will undoubtedly be observed by many telescopes, it is a rare opportunity to cross-calibrate all telescopes using supernovae themselves.  The Pan-STARRS telescope has already observed the entire Campaign 16 footprint and has been ubercalibrated across the entire sky, making it the ideal system to be the anchor.

Finally, we will monitor all newly discovered supernovae at high cadence in multiple bands.  Because of our different sites, we will be able to monitor the supernovae for a particularly long continuous period.  Our filtered observations at these early times will provide important color information to complement the Kepler light curves.

In addition to our photometric resources, we will spectroscopically observe these supernovae with telescopes from Lick, Keck, Las Campanas, Apache Point, Cerro Tololo, and Kitt Peak observatories."

We propose to exploit the unprecedented photometric precision and temporal coverage of K2 observations to investigate the correlation between optical and gamma-ray light curves in blazars. For this purpose, we have selected a sample of gamma-ray detected and gamma-ray candidate blazars that fall on the K2 silicon footprint during the upcoming observation cycle.

GO16104,16,Benjamin,J,Shappee,Carnegie Observatories,ben.shappee@gmail.com,"van Saders, Jennifer Lynn; Schmidt, Sarah Jane",ASASSN-14mz: An Extreme flare on an ultracool dwarf,"Stellar flares are dramatic multi-wavelength emission events that occur in the surface magnetic fields of stars across the main sequence. Flares are particularly common on early- to mid-M dwarfs, where decades of observations have indicated that these flares are analogs of weaker events on our own Sun. Beyond their intrinsic value as tests of stellar astrophysics, M dwarfs are important as exoplanet host stars: they are the most abundant stars in the galaxy, and, because Earth-size planets in the stellar habitable zone are far easier to detect around M dwarfs, they are primary targets of many upcoming and ongoing planet-hunting missions and surveys (K2, MEarth, TESS, MINERVA- Red, etc.). However, because they are so magnetically active, M dwarfs pose unique challenges to our understanding of planetary habitability. Several authors have discussed the effects of flaring M dwarfs on nearby planets (Heath et al. 1999; Tarter et al. 2007; Segura et al. 2010), but studies thus far are restricted to scenarios in which planets experience flares fluxes a factor of more than 100 below that predicted for planets in the habitable zones of the strongest discovered flares. Furthermore, because these large flares are rare, the flaring rate at the highest energies is poorly constrained.

The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) is a long-term project, designed to monitor the entire visible sky every 2-3 days, whose primary goal is to find all of the closest supernovae (SNe) with an unbiased search. This systematic all-sky technique has enabled ASAS- SN to discover 30+ extreme flares (_x005F_x005FV e 4 mag) from low-mass stars, including the four largest M-dwarf flares ever detected (Stanek et al. 2013; Schmidt et al. 2014; Simonian et al. 2014, 2016) and the second and largest (_x005F_x005FV e 11 mag) L-dwarf flare (Schmidt et al. 2016). The key advantage of ASAS-SN is that our surveyed volume is nearby, by the virtue of our shallow scanning strategy across the entire sky. Thus, when we detect a flare, they are typically V < 16 mag or brighter, making it possible to characterize the star in quiescence.

On 2014 Dec. 24.4 UT the ASAS-SN transient pipeline triggered on a 13.21 mag transient at RA = 08:51:13.9 Dec = +19:12:21. 5 J2000. The transient then faded 0.23 mag in 110 seconds between our two dithered images. Archival SDSS and 2MASS data show a faint source at this location (r = 18.73 and V < 19.5) whose broad-band photometry is consistent with a mid-M dwarf (M6). Other than this one dramatic event, no other flares have been seen in the 462 times ASAS-SN has observed this location over the last 5 years.

Out of the unique sample of M-dwarf flares that ASAS-SN has found, only ASASSN-14mz will be in an upcoming K2 field. This provides a unique opportunity to constrain the rate of smaller flares (_x005F_x005F < 0.5  1 mag) on a star that we known has undergone a flare 100 times larger. These smaller flares are expected from an average field M6 roughly once an hour. While large flares can last an hour, smaller flares last minutes, so short cadence observations are required. Such observations will also yield a rotation period, the critical second dimension in understanding the flaring behavior of low-mass stars as a function of stellar type and age. ASASSN-14mz expected to be on silicon (neither on a dead module nor chip gap) during in Campaign 16. Measuring rotation and the rates of smaller flares on ASASSN-14mz will provide a new insights into the magnetic fields of these stars, regardless of whether we find that ASASSN-14mzs flare rate is below-normal, average, or active."

Local field dwarfs with a metallicity enhancement of only a factor of two over the solar value show a three- to four-fold increase in the frequency of close-in giant-planet companions. The giant-planet occurrence rate continues to drop at sub-solar metallicity, with very few known planetary systems around stars with [Fe/H] < −0.8 1 . This observed correlation of giant-planet frequency and stellar metallicity is most easily understood within the context of the core-accretion model of planet formation (e.g. Pollack et al., 1996). Gas giant planet embryos form beyond the “ice-line” where there is an abundance of solid material to form a planetary core. Those planets that reach the stage of rapid gas accretion while there is still a substantial circumstellar disk can migrate inward through gravitational tidal interactions with the disk. Thus, the correlation of giant planets with stellar metallicity might result naturally from the larger abundance of planet-building material in the disk surrounding a metal-rich star. However, there are two important caveats to this observed relationship. First, the observed distribution has a long tail extending to low-metallicity stars. This means that giant-planets can indeed form at a reduced rate around relatively metal-poor stars, perhaps still by core accretion or possibly by some other planet-building process such as disk gravitational instability (Boss, 2002). An open question remains as to whether there is a low-metallicity threshold for giant-planet formation (Mordasini et al., 2012). Second, this correlation is not seen for super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al., 2012). Thus, the relationship between the elemental abundances of the parent star and the architectures of the planetary systems is not nearly as simple and obvious as was commonly thought several years ago."

Just after our first K2 observations of OJ 287, a strong optical outburst occurred which was predicted by modelling of the secondary black hole passing through the accretion disk around the primary black hole. The passage may have changed the variability characteristics of the optical emission from the relativistic jet. Our K2 observations show that blazars can have powerful individual flares that could be caused by a strong individual component in the jet, superimposed on emission that shows fractal variability on all timescales. The slopes of the power spectral densities of their light curves are consistent with relativistic jet turbulence. We also propose to observe five gamma-ray blazars not yet observed by K2."

In addition, we propose to observe several brighter candidate gamma Doradus/delta Scuti and hybrid stars identified in earlier campaigns in short cadence, to search for additional modes, study amplitude variability, and remove the frequency ambiguity caused by the 24.5 cycle/day Nyquist frequency reflections present in long-cadence observations.

From from the accretion discs which power active galactic nuclei (parsecs), proto-planetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting neutron stars or white dwarfs (few thousand km), the flow of material and angular momentum is governed by the same underlying physical processes. The timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion flows around white dwarfs are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure, the effects of accretion rate variations, and accretion flows along magnetic field lines, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Accreting white dwarfs (cataclysmic variables, CVs) display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), white dwarf pulsations (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and precession of the accretion disc (days). The capability of K2 (and the original Kepler mission) to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is unique, and allows us to sample the variability over a range of timescales that is not possible with ground-based observations. K2 has the additional advantage that it allows us to study a more diverse and representative population of accreting binaries than was possible in the single, fixed Kepler field. The resulting library of high quality light curves from K2 will provide a diverse, representative observational sample from which to investigate disc-based phenomena."

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution. These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes, photometry, multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameter(s) of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above.

We propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates and amplitudes as two of the key approaches to solve the width problem. In K2 fields 17, 18 and 19, we will observe 18 nearby systems 1 , including seven K dwarfs and eleven M dwarfs. These stars are the closest K and M dwarfs in these three fields other than those stars overlapped with previous fields. Along with previous nearby stars we proposed in K2, the K2 mission has observed 74 nearest K and M dwarfs. Observing these additional 18 stars and as well as others observed in the upcoming tess mission will not only provide crucial data to understand the width of the MS, but has a opportunity to detect any transiting planet sytem similar to TRAPPIST-1.

Stars which have evolved beyond the main sequence can vary on a wide range of timescales, from a few hours to hundreds of days, even in the same star. K2’s 80-day observing window and its 29-minute sample rate make it ideal for investigating these variations. However, most previous Kepler and K2 observations of evolved stars have concentrated on oxygen-rich samples [e.g., 1, 2], probably because they outnumber the carbon stars, at least in the Milky Way. Carbon stars, though, may be responsible for at least half the dust returned to the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) [e.g., 10, 5], and may even dominate dust production in the early Universe [e.g., 21, 8]. To investigate this important population, we recently acquired K2 observations of evolved carbon stars. While we are still analyzing those data, we are, indeed, finding variations on the order of a few hours to tens of days. However, those stars were primarily in the Galactic plane and suffer from crowding effects. The next set of K2 fields, most likely the last, contain more than thirty known carbon stars that are toward the bulge and halo. With these new data, we will significantly expand the sample of this important population with high quality K2 data. With a robust sample of carbon stars, we can also test asteroseismologic techniques and models that have been developed for oxygen-rich stars [e.g., 4], potentially determining parameters like mass, radius, and surface gravity, independent of their unknown distances."

Intriguingly, a similar carbon enhancement is observed in dwarf stars, a strong indication of extrinsic carbon pollution. The prototype dwarf carbon (dC) star (G77-61; Dahn et al. 1977) exhibits clear halo kinematics, and is extremely metal poor ([Fe/H] = −4.03; Plez & Cohen 2005). This star is also a single lined spectroscopic binary, with a presumably cold white dwarf secondary (Dearborn et al. 1986). These data support efficient binary mass transfer, from a carbon-rich giant onto a solar-type main-sequence star. Among the growing number of dC stars discovered in the SDSS, there are more than a dozen that exhibit Hα emission, suggesting these stars are spun up due to mass transfer and subsequent accretion. We propose to observe all dC stars in the upcoming K2 campaign fields to measure and constrain rotation periods and flares.

They are compact stars and the majority are located on the blue extension of the horizontal branch, earning them the designation extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars. They are helium burning cores of low-mass stars (<2.0 solar masses) that ignited helium through the core-helium flash when their cores reached the required mass of 0.47 solar mass. They have effective temperatures between 20000 and 40000K and the surface gravities (in logarithmic cgs units) between 5.0 and 6.0. (Heber 2016). For the envelope to become this thin, some process, which is still under investigation, must have stripped off the majority of the mass during or immediately after the first red-giant branch stage. Subdwarf B stars are idealized laboratories for studying the deep interiors of helium burning red giants, and can provide important constraints on their evolution.

Kilkenny et al. (1997) discovered the first pulsating sdB (sdBV) star and this has opened the way to study their interiors using asteroseismology. Charpinet et al. (1997) calculated theoretical models of sdBV stars and explained the flux variations as pressure (p) modes driven by the kappa-mechanism, which works on iron opacities, the so-called Z-bump. When sdBV stars were discovered, a monitoring of their flux variation was limited to ground-based observations. Therefore, observations with decent coverage were limited to those pulsators that were fairly bright and showed relatively high pulsation amplitudes and short periods. These objects could be reliably observed with relatively small telescopes so that they could be observed for durations sufficient to explore the detailed structure of the pulsations. The amplitude spectra of ground based data showed many peaks associated with pulsation modes. However, in spite of dedicated efforts on many targets, features that could allow mode identification were usually not found.

The sdBV stars were high-priority targets observed by the Kepler spacecraft from the onset. During the original mission (K1), a survey of ~100 compact pulsator candidates was undertaken (Østensen 2010, 2011), and almost 20 such objects were discovered. They were monitored for up to 3.5 years, which helped us to obtain an exceptionally low noise level and unprecedented frequency resolution, leading to discoveries of many rotationally split multiplets and reliable asymptotic period spacings. These two features are very useful in mode identification, owing to which the application of asteroseismology should be easier than in case of sdBV stars observed from the ground. During the K2 mission, thus far, we have found another 29 sdBV stars. The total sample of stars observed from space is now comparable with the one observed from the ground, though, the superior precision of the former is making them much more relevant for modeling purposes. We expect to find/observe more sdBV stars during the remaining Campaigns 17-19 of K2 mission."

The detection of the first transit of planetary objects orbiting a white dwarf came in the first campaign of K2 (Vanderburg et al. 2015), and likely signals just the beginning of new detections of an exciting class of planetary systems. Follow-up photometry (Croll et al. 2015, Gaensicke et al. 2016) and spectroscopy (Xu et al. 2016) show that the system is dynamic and changing on short (days to weeks) timescales. Our team is involved in the immediate follow-up, both photometrically (Gaensicke et al. 2016) and spectroscopically (Redfield et al. 2016, see Fig. 1).

A search of the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog now identifies 2,441 additional high-velocity stars that are likely members of the Galactic halo, which will be visible in K2 campaigns C17-C18-C19, and which have also not been targeted in previous campaigns. We propose to target all those stars with K2 to continue our search for eclipsing systems, as well as for the potential identification of exoplanet transits. Based on previous success rates, we expect to find a few (1-3) additional eclipsing systems within this final subset of local galactic halo stars for K2."

However, the high-precision photometry of K2 also means that longer-period objects are detectable from a single transit or eclipse. We propose to reobserve 65 targets that were previously studied with K2 and which our search has detected evidence for a long-period planetary or binary companion. The reobservation of transits or eclipses will allow the period to be determined, enabling long-period transiting plants to be validated or confirmed with K2 for the first time.

These observations have led to the detection of hundreds of new planet candidates and detailed characterization of bright, nearby, or otherwise remarkable planetary systems (e.g. Foreman-Mackey et al., 2015; Montet et al., 2015; Luger et al., 2016). As successful as K2 has been, it has limits. With observations lasting only 75 days, most detected planets have orbital periods shorter than ≈30 days, so they are outside the habitable zone for most host stars. Additionally, the short baseline can cause large uncertainties on the orbital period, meaning transits can be lost before detailed follow-up by telescopes like JWST can be performed (Fukui et al., 2016).

We propose continued observations of the planet population discovered in previous K2 fields. These observations will enable us to detect and understand long-term transit timing variations (TTVs) in these systems. We will also improve our measurements of the transit times, enabling future atmospheric studies to be more effectively carried out without wasting resources. Given the small sizes of some of these planets and faintness of some host stars, many of these transits cannot be observed from the ground: K2 represents the only opportunity to follow up many of these systems for the next decade. Additionally, we will be able to secure three transits of longer-period planets in these systems, enabling the characterization of K2’s longest-period transiting planets."

K2 should detect 6–21 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in this sample during Cycle 6 (90% confidence using current SN rates [6], Poisson statistics, and including systematic uncertainties).

To take full advantage of the K2 SN Cosmology Experiment, we will photometrically follow all SN candidates with four telescopes: the 1.8-m Pan-STARRS (PS1), 1.5-m RATIR, 1-m Nickel and 1-m Swope. In combination, we will observe every K2 SN in 13 bands (uBVgrRiIzyYJH). The different sites/longitudes allow for improved cadence and mitigate against poor weather and telescope/instrument problems at a single site. Additionally, PS1 and the Swope telescope are particularly well-calibrated [12, 14, 19]. PS1 was used to discover ∼5000 high-z SNe and is currently used for the low-z Foundation survey (Foley et al., submitted). The Swope telescope was used for the Carnegie SN Project [3], which has also observed hundreds of SNe [5]. Observations on these well-calibrated systems will directly link the K2 SNe to thousands of other SNe observed on these systems.

Our program has 3 main goals. 1: we will provide the best distances to SNe Ia. This will allow us to improve K2 measurements of important physical parameters such as radii of the progenitor stars and to look for subtle correlations between K2 light curves and Hubble residuals. 2: we will use the K2 SNe Ia as a “Rosetta” sample, anchored to the PS1 system. As the K2 SNe will be observed by many telescopes, it is a rare opportunity to cross-calibrate all telescopes using SNe themselves. 3: we will monitor all newly discovered SNe at high cadence in multiple bands.

GO17054,17,Tomomi,,Otani,Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University,OTANIT@erau.edu,"Buzasi, Derek; Davenport, James; Oswalt, Terry",Gyrochronology and Magnetic Activity in Wide Binaries with K2,"Precise ages for field stars are a critical fundamental parameter for advancing our knowledge of the Milky Way’s formation history. Likewise, understanding exoplanetary formation and habitability depends on accurate stellar ages. Stars lose angular momentum as they age, causing their rotation rates to slow over time (Skumanich 1972). Assuming stars are born with an initial distribution of rotation periods and gradually spin down, this angular momentum evolution provides a useful clock – a technique known as ""gyrochronology"". As the stars spin down the internal magnetic dynamo also diminishes; this process has been dubbed ""magnetochronology"". As rotation slows, decreased magnetic activity results in smaller starspot filling factors, lower levels of X-ray and UV emission, and decreased flare rates. Flares have been recently shown to decline as stars spin down. However, ~12% of flaring wide binaries in Kepler show differing levels of flare activity between components (Clarke & Davenport in Prep).

While stellar rotation is reliably recovered for many stars with Kepler/K2 (Aigrain et al. 2015), the accuracy of ages determined from these periods is debated, with typical uncertainties of ~1 Gyr. Furthermore, prescriptions for gyrochronology relations have been devised using a variety of calibrations, ranging from young open clusters at fixed ages (e.g. Barnes 2010, Meibom et al. 2011), to asteroseismology-based ages for solar mass stars (e.g. Angus 2015). None of these models yield reliable or uniform age estimates for stars at all ages and masses. Widely separated common proper motion binary stars provide a unique benchmark for testing these competing gyrochronology relations across all masses and ages, and for potentially creating an independent spin-down calibration. The range of rotation rates, ages and masses among the wide binaries selected for our study can populate the entire rotation-mass-age surface and help resolve the current disagreement between rotation and asteroseismology ages (cf. García et al. 2014; Barnes et al. 2016; dos Santos et al. 2016; Gonzales 2016; van Saders et al. 2016).

We are proposing for long cadence observations of ~180 wide binary systems (total 369 stars) with K2 Campaign 17, 18, and 19. Our study has three objectives: 1. Calibrate the stellar rotation–age paradigm using wide main sequence (MS) binaries, where components are coeval and have evolved independently; and 2. Quantify the flaring rate among the MS+MS binaries as a function of age. This dataset will build on our previous successful proposal for total ~1060 binaries from Campaign 5, 14, 15, as well as the ~200 systems in the original Kepler field. In total, we hope to create a publicly available catalog of wide binary systems at a range of masses and ages to calibrate evolution of the age-rotation–activity relation."

Most of them also show evidence of flaring activity in the long-cadence K2 light curves, and have significant UV excess. The low-cadence (30-minutes) of the K2 observations, however, does not allow the flaring behavior to be examined in detail; high cadence observations of these very active and flaring M dwarfs would reveal much more about the frequency of flaring events, and would allow one to correlate the flaring behavior with the observed changes in the spot patterns on those stars. Campaigns 17-18-19 overlap significantly with earlier campaigns.

Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models.

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler and K2 orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small, and the properties of the systems to date do not adequately sample the desired range of planetary and stellar properties.

We propose a ranked list of 12,481 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We generated this list by first searching for all moderately bright stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 17, 18, and 19, and then using the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs.

Local field dwarfs with a metallicity enhancement of only a factor of two over the solar value show a three- to four-fold increase in the frequency of close-in giant-planet companions. The giant-planet occurrence rate continues to drop at sub-solar metallicity, with very few known planetary systems around stars with [Fe/H] < −0.8 1 . This observed correlation of giant-planet frequency and stellar metallicity is most easily understood within the context of the core-accretion model of planet formation (e.g. Pollack et al., 1996). Gas giant planet embryos form beyond the “ice-line” where there is an abundance of solid material to form a planetary core. Those planets that reach the stage of rapid gas accretion while there is still a substantial circumstellar disk can migrate inward through gravitational tidal interactions with the disk. Thus, the correlation of giant planets with stellar metallicity might result naturally from the larger abundance of planet-building material in the disk surrounding a metal-rich star. However, there are two important caveats to this observed relationship. First, the observed distribution has a long tail extending to low-metallicity stars. This means that giant-planets can indeed form at a reduced rate around relatively metal-poor stars, perhaps still by core accretion or possibly by some other planet-building process such as disk gravitational instability (Boss, 2002). An open question remains as to whether there is a low-metallicity threshold for giant-planet formation (Mordasini et al., 2012). Second, this correlation is not seen for super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al., 2012). Thus, the relationship between the elemental abundances of the parent star and the architectures of the planetary systems is not nearly as simple and obvious as was commonly thought several years ago."

High-precision monitoring of cool stars and brown dwarfs will prove to be particularly useful for understanding the variability nature of these objects in the visible, even if no transit is detected throughout the sample (see Demory et al. 2013b)."

Just after our first K2 observations of OJ 287, a strong optical outburst occurred which was predicted by modelling of the secondary black hole passing through the accretion disk around the primary black hole. The passage may have changed the variability characteristics of the optical emission from the relativistic jet. Our K2 observations show that blazars can have powerful individual flares that could be caused by a strong individual component in the jet, superimposed on emission that shows fractal variability on all timescales. The slopes of the power spectral densities of their light curves are consistent with relativistic jet turbulence. We also propose to observe five gamma-ray blazars not yet observed by K2."

From from the accretion discs which power active galactic nuclei (parsecs), proto-planetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting neutron stars or white dwarfs (few thousand km), the flow of material and angular momentum is governed by the same underlying physical processes. The timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion flows around white dwarfs are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure, the effects of accretion rate variations, and accretion flows along magnetic field lines, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Accreting white dwarfs (cataclysmic variables, CVs) display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), white dwarf pulsations (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and precession of the accretion disc (days). The capability of K2 (and the original Kepler mission) to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is unique, and allows us to sample the variability over a range of timescales that is not possible with ground-based observations. K2 has the additional advantage that it allows us to study a more diverse and representative population of accreting binaries than was possible in the single, fixed Kepler field. The resulting library of high quality light curves from K2 will provide a diverse, representative observational sample from which to investigate disc-based phenomena."

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution. These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes, photometry, multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameter(s) of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above.

We propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates and amplitudes as two of the key approaches to solve the width problem. In K2 fields 17, 18 and 19, we will observe 18 nearby systems 1 , including seven K dwarfs and eleven M dwarfs. These stars are the closest K and M dwarfs in these three fields other than those stars overlapped with previous fields. Along with previous nearby stars we proposed in K2, the K2 mission has observed 74 nearest K and M dwarfs. Observing these additional 18 stars and as well as others observed in the upcoming tess mission will not only provide crucial data to understand the width of the MS, but has a opportunity to detect any transiting planet sytem similar to TRAPPIST-1.

J.",Investigating Galactic Carbon Stars with K2: The Bulge and Halo Population,"We propose to observe 32 evolved carbon stars in the long-cadence mode in K2 fields F17, F18, and F19. Stars which have evolved beyond the main sequence can vary on a wide range of timescales, from a few hours to hundreds of days, even in the same star. K2’s 80-day observing window and its 29-minute sample rate make it ideal for investigating these variations. However, most previous Kepler and K2 observations of evolved stars have concentrated on oxygen-rich samples [e.g., 1, 2], probably because they outnumber the carbon stars, at least in the Milky Way. Carbon stars, though, may be responsible for at least half the dust returned to the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) [e.g., 10, 5], and may even dominate dust production in the early Universe [e.g., 21, 8]. To investigate this important population, we recently acquired K2 observations of evolved carbon stars. While we are still analyzing those data, we are, indeed, finding variations on the order of a few hours to tens of days. However, those stars were primarily in the Galactic plane and suffer from crowding effects. The next set of K2 fields, most likely the last, contain more than thirty known carbon stars that are toward the bulge and halo. With these new data, we will significantly expand the sample of this important population with high quality K2 data. With a robust sample of carbon stars, we can also test asteroseismologic techniques and models that have been developed for oxygen-rich stars [e.g., 4], potentially determining parameters like mass, radius, and surface gravity, independent of their unknown distances."

Intriguingly, a similar carbon enhancement is observed in dwarf stars, a strong indication of extrinsic carbon pollution. The prototype dwarf carbon (dC) star (G77-61; Dahn et al. 1977) exhibits clear halo kinematics, and is extremely metal poor ([Fe/H] = −4.03; Plez & Cohen 2005). This star is also a single lined spectroscopic binary, with a presumably cold white dwarf secondary (Dearborn et al. 1986). These data support efficient binary mass transfer, from a carbon-rich giant onto a solar-type main-sequence star. Among the growing number of dC stars discovered in the SDSS, there are more than a dozen that exhibit Hα emission, suggesting these stars are spun up due to mass transfer and subsequent accretion. We propose to observe all dC stars in the upcoming K2 campaign fields to measure and constrain rotation periods and flares.

These alterations are the most dramatic in the first Gyr, which has motivated the search for younger planets to better understand the dominant physical drivers of such changes. However, identification of planets during this era is complicated by increased stellar variability and because ages of stars (and their planets) are difficult to determine. Thus the overwhelming majority of planets discovered by Kepler and earlier surveys are old (>1 Gyr) or have poorly constrained/unknown ages, and are ineffective for studying exoplanet evolution.

K2 has observed of a number of young clusters and star forming regions with known ages (Praesepe, Hyades, Pleiades, Upper Scorpius, and Taurus-Auriga), enabling the discovery of planets ranging from 5-800 Myr by our (ZEIT) and similar surveys (e.g., Obermeier et al. 2016; Mann et al. 2017). From these data we have shown that young planets are statistically larger than their older counterparts (Figure 1a, Mann et al. 2016a), and that while at least some planets migrate through interaction with their protoplanetary disk (Mann et al. 2016b; David et al. 2016), most super-Earth- and Neptune-sized planets migrate through a slower process, taking 100-800 Myr to reach short orbital periods (Figure 1b, Rizzuto et al. in prep).

While the existing young exoplanet sample has proven enormously useful for studies of exoplanet evolution, we are limited heavily by the range of orbital periods probed by K2 (<30 days). The third visit to Praesepe in Campaign 18 offers a unique opportunity by providing high-precision photometry spanning three years. Here we propose for K2 observations of Praesepe targets observed in earlier campaigns; the combination enables the discovery of planets and EBs at periods far outside the reach of earlier campaigns alone."

They are compact stars and the majority are located on the blue extension of the horizontal branch, earning them the designation extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars. They are helium burning cores of low-mass stars (<2.0 solar masses) that ignited helium through the core-helium flash when their cores reached the required mass of 0.47 solar mass. They have effective temperatures between 20000 and 40000K and the surface gravities (in logarithmic cgs units) between 5.0 and 6.0. (Heber 2016). For the envelope to become this thin, some process, which is still under investigation, must have stripped off the majority of the mass during or immediately after the first red-giant branch stage. Subdwarf B stars are idealized laboratories for studying the deep interiors of helium burning red giants, and can provide important constraints on their evolution.

Kilkenny et al. (1997) discovered the first pulsating sdB (sdBV) star and this has opened the way to study their interiors using asteroseismology. Charpinet et al. (1997) calculated theoretical models of sdBV stars and explained the flux variations as pressure (p) modes driven by the kappa-mechanism, which works on iron opacities, the so-called Z-bump. When sdBV stars were discovered, a monitoring of their flux variation was limited to ground-based observations. Therefore, observations with decent coverage were limited to those pulsators that were fairly bright and showed relatively high pulsation amplitudes and short periods. These objects could be reliably observed with relatively small telescopes so that they could be observed for durations sufficient to explore the detailed structure of the pulsations. The amplitude spectra of ground based data showed many peaks associated with pulsation modes. However, in spite of dedicated efforts on many targets, features that could allow mode identification were usually not found.

The sdBV stars were high-priority targets observed by the Kepler spacecraft from the onset. During the original mission (K1), a survey of ~100 compact pulsator candidates was undertaken (Østensen 2010, 2011), and almost 20 such objects were discovered. They were monitored for up to 3.5 years, which helped us to obtain an exceptionally low noise level and unprecedented frequency resolution, leading to discoveries of many rotationally split multiplets and reliable asymptotic period spacings. These two features are very useful in mode identification, owing to which the application of asteroseismology should be easier than in case of sdBV stars observed from the ground. During the K2 mission, thus far, we have found another 29 sdBV stars. The total sample of stars observed from space is now comparable with the one observed from the ground, though, the superior precision of the former is making them much more relevant for modeling purposes. We expect to find/observe more sdBV stars during the remaining Campaigns 17-19 of K2 mission."

The detection of the first transit of planetary objects orbiting a white dwarf came in the first campaign of K2 (Vanderburg et al. 2015), and likely signals just the beginning of new detections of an exciting class of planetary systems. Follow-up photometry (Croll et al. 2015, Gaensicke et al. 2016) and spectroscopy (Xu et al. 2016) show that the system is dynamic and changing on short (days to weeks) timescales. Our team is involved in the immediate follow-up, both photometrically (Gaensicke et al. 2016) and spectroscopically (Redfield et al. 2016, see Fig. 1).

The K2 mission has contributed all of the confirmed transiting exoplanets in sub-Gyr clusters, including six in the Praesepe cluster (M44; τ ≈ 800 Myr). Some of these planets are anomalously large, perhaps owing to ongoing radius evolution. Moreover, no transiting hot Jupiter has yet been detected from K2 observations of thousands of young stars (<1 Gyr), despite being easily detectable from K2 data; this raises questions about whether the prevalence of these planets is different in young populations (due to e.g. continuing orbital migration). The young transiting planets discovered by K2 will form the foundation for comparative exoplanet studies that isolate time as the key parameter of interest. K2 Campaign 18 observations of the Praesepe cluster will extend the observational baseline to >140 d for 1030 members, and to >210 d for up to 483 members. The combined data for Praesepe will thus be sensitive to planets at longer periods, compared to other young clusters observed by K2. The K2 Praesepe data will also be a legacy data set from which a range of other astrophysics can be investigated, including angular momentum evolution, starspot lifetimes, differential rotation, and stellar multiplicity."

These observations have led to the detection of hundreds of new planet candidates and detailed characterization of bright, nearby, or otherwise remarkable planetary systems (e.g. Foreman-Mackey et al., 2015; Montet et al., 2015; Luger et al., 2016). As successful as K2 has been, it has limits. With observations lasting only 75 days, most detected planets have orbital periods shorter than ≈30 days, so they are outside the habitable zone for most host stars. Additionally, the short baseline can cause large uncertainties on the orbital period, meaning transits can be lost before detailed follow-up by telescopes like JWST can be performed (Fukui et al., 2016).

We propose continued observations of the planet population discovered in previous K2 fields. These observations will enable us to detect and understand long-term transit timing variations (TTVs) in these systems. We will also improve our measurements of the transit times, enabling future atmospheric studies to be more effectively carried out without wasting resources. Given the small sizes of some of these planets and faintness of some host stars, many of these transits cannot be observed from the ground: K2 represents the only opportunity to follow up many of these systems for the next decade.

Likewise, understanding exoplanetary formation and habitability depends on accurate stellar ages. Stars lose angular momentum as they age, causing their rotation rates to slow over time (Skumanich 1972). Assuming stars are born with an initial distribution of rotation periods and gradually spin down, this angular momentum evolution provides a useful clock – a technique known as ""gyrochronology"". As the stars spin down the internal magnetic dynamo also diminishes; this process has been dubbed ""magnetochronology"". As rotation slows, decreased magnetic activity results in smaller starspot filling factors, lower levels of X-ray and UV emission, and decreased flare rates. Flares have been recently shown to decline as stars spin down. However, ~12% of flaring wide binaries in Kepler show differing levels of flare activity between components (Clarke & Davenport in Prep).

While stellar rotation is reliably recovered for many stars with Kepler/K2 (Aigrain et al. 2015), the accuracy of ages determined from these periods is debated, with typical uncertainties of ~1 Gyr. Furthermore, prescriptions for gyrochronology relations have been devised using a variety of calibrations, ranging from young open clusters at fixed ages (e.g. Barnes 2010, Meibom et al. 2011), to asteroseismology-based ages for solar mass stars (e.g. Angus 2015). None of these models yield reliable or uniform age estimates for stars at all ages and masses. Widely separated common proper motion binary stars provide a unique benchmark for testing these competing gyrochronology relations across all masses and ages, and for potentially creating an independent spin-down calibration. The range of rotation rates, ages and masses among the wide binaries selected for our study can populate the entire rotation-mass-age surface and help resolve the current disagreement between rotation and asteroseismology ages (cf. García et al. 2014; Barnes et al. 2016; dos Santos et al. 2016; Gonzales 2016; van Saders et al. 2016).

We are proposing for long cadence observations of ~180 wide binary systems (total 369 stars) with K2 Campaign 17, 18, and 19. Our study has three objectives: 1. Calibrate the stellar rotation–age paradigm using wide main sequence (MS) binaries, where components are coeval and have evolved independently; and 2. Quantify the flaring rate among the MS+MS binaries as a function of age. This dataset will build on our previous successful proposal for total ~1060 binaries from Campaign 5, 14, 15, as well as the ~200 systems in the original Kepler field. In total, we hope to create a publicly available catalog of wide binary systems at a range of masses and ages to calibrate evolution of the age-rotation–activity relation."

Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models.

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler and K2 orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small, and the properties of the systems to date do not adequately sample the desired range of planetary and stellar properties.

GO19003,19,William,,Cochran,University of Texas at Austin,wdc@astro.as.utexas.edu,"Endl, Michael; Gandolfi, Davide; Patzold, Martin; Rauer, Heike",Planets and Stellar Populations,"A major result from high precision radial velocity surveys of local field stars for extrasolar planets that has dramatically shaped our thinking about the formation of planetary systems is the very strong tendency for gas-giant planets to be found around metal-rich stars (Gonzalez, 1997; Fischer & Valenti, 2005). Local field dwarfs with a metallicity enhancement of only a factor of two over the solar value show a three- to four-fold increase in the frequency of close-in giant-planet companions. The giant-planet occurrence rate continues to drop at sub-solar metallicity, with very few known planetary systems around stars with [Fe/H] < −0.8 1 . This observed correlation of giant-planet frequency and stellar metallicity is most easily understood within the context of the core-accretion model of planet formation (e.g. Pollack et al., 1996). Gas giant planet embryos form beyond the “ice-line” where there is an abundance of solid material to form a planetary core. Those planets that reach the stage of rapid gas accretion while there is still a substantial circumstellar disk can migrate inward through gravitational tidal interactions with the disk. Thus, the correlation of giant planets with stellar metallicity might result naturally from the larger abundance of planet-building material in the disk surrounding a metal-rich star. However, there are two important caveats to this observed relationship. First, the observed distribution has a long tail extending to low-metallicity stars. This means that giant-planets can indeed form at a reduced rate around relatively metal-poor stars, perhaps still by core accretion or possibly by some other planet-building process such as disk gravitational instability (Boss, 2002). An open question remains as to whether there is a low-metallicity threshold for giant-planet formation (Mordasini et al., 2012). Second, this correlation is not seen for super-Earth and Earth-size planets (Buchhave et al., 2012). Thus, the relationship between the elemental abundances of the parent star and the architectures of the planetary systems is not nearly as simple and obvious as was commonly thought several years ago."

The passage may have changed the variability characteristics of the optical emission from the relativistic jet. Our K2 observations show that blazars can have powerful individual flares that could be caused by a strong individual component in the jet, superimposed on emission that shows fractal variability on all timescales.

From from the accretion discs which power active galactic nuclei (parsecs), proto-planetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting neutron stars or white dwarfs (few thousand km), the flow of material and angular momentum is governed by the same underlying physical processes. The timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion flows around white dwarfs are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure, the effects of accretion rate variations, and accretion flows along magnetic field lines, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Accreting white dwarfs (cataclysmic variables, CVs) display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), white dwarf pulsations (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and precession of the accretion disc (days). The capability of K2 (and the original Kepler mission) to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is unique, and allows us to sample the variability over a range of timescales that is not possible with ground-based observations. K2 has the additional advantage that it allows us to study a more diverse and representative population of accreting binaries than was possible in the single, fixed Kepler field. The resulting library of high quality light curves from K2 will provide a diverse, representative observational sample from which to investigate disc-based phenomena."

Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution. These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes, photometry, multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameter(s) of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above.

Stars which have evolved beyond the main sequence can vary on a wide range of timescales, from a few hours to hundreds of days, even in the same star. K2’s 80-day observing window and its 29-minute sample rate make it ideal for investigating these variations. However, most previous Kepler and K2 observations of evolved stars have concentrated on oxygen-rich samples [e.g., 1, 2], probably because they outnumber the carbon stars, at least in the Milky Way. Carbon stars, though, may be responsible for at least half the dust returned to the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) [e.g., 10, 5], and may even dominate dust production in the early Universe [e.g., 21, 8]. To investigate this important population, we recently acquired K2 observations of evolved carbon stars. While we are still analyzing those data, we are, indeed, finding variations on the order of a few hours to tens of days. However, those stars were primarily in the Galactic plane and suffer from crowding effects. The next set of K2 fields, most likely the last, contain more than thirty known carbon stars that are toward the bulge and halo. With these new data, we will significantly expand the sample of this important population with high quality K2 data. With a robust sample of carbon stars, we can also test asteroseismologic techniques and models that have been developed for oxygen-rich stars [e.g., 4], potentially determining parameters like mass, radius, and surface gravity, independent of their unknown distances."

Intriguingly, a similar carbon enhancement is observed in dwarf stars, a strong indication of extrinsic carbon pollution. The prototype dwarf carbon (dC) star (G77-61; Dahn et al. 1977) exhibits clear halo kinematics, and is extremely metal poor ([Fe/H] = −4.03; Plez & Cohen 2005). This star is also a single lined spectroscopic binary, with a presumably cold white dwarf secondary (Dearborn et al. 1986). These data support efficient binary mass transfer, from a carbon-rich giant onto a solar-type main-sequence star. Among the growing number of dC stars discovered in the SDSS, there are more than a dozen that exhibit Hα emission, suggesting these stars are spun up due to mass transfer and subsequent accretion. We propose to observe all dC stars in the upcoming K2 campaign fields to measure and constrain rotation periods and flares.

They are compact stars and the majority are located on the blue extension of the horizontal branch, earning them the designation extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars. They are helium burning cores of low-mass stars (<2.0 solar masses) that ignited helium through the core-helium flash when their cores reached the required mass of 0.47 solar mass. They have effective temperatures between 20000 and 40000K and the surface gravities (in logarithmic cgs units) between 5.0 and 6.0. (Heber 2016). For the envelope to become this thin, some process, which is still under investigation, must have stripped off the majority of the mass during or immediately after the first red-giant branch stage. Subdwarf B stars are idealized laboratories for studying the deep interiors of helium burning red giants, and can provide important constraints on their evolution.

Kilkenny et al. (1997) discovered the first pulsating sdB (sdBV) star and this has opened the way to study their interiors using asteroseismology. Charpinet et al. (1997) calculated theoretical models of sdBV stars and explained the flux variations as pressure (p) modes driven by the kappa-mechanism, which works on iron opacities, the so-called Z-bump. When sdBV stars were discovered, a monitoring of their flux variation was limited to ground-based observations. Therefore, observations with decent coverage were limited to those pulsators that were fairly bright and showed relatively high pulsation amplitudes and short periods. These objects could be reliably observed with relatively small telescopes so that they could be observed for durations sufficient to explore the detailed structure of the pulsations. The amplitude spectra of ground based data showed many peaks associated with pulsation modes. However, in spite of dedicated efforts on many targets, features that could allow mode identification were usually not found.

The sdBV stars were high-priority targets observed by the Kepler spacecraft from the onset. During the original mission (K1), a survey of ~100 compact pulsator candidates was undertaken (Østensen 2010, 2011), and almost 20 such objects were discovered. They were monitored for up to 3.5 years, which helped us to obtain an exceptionally low noise level and unprecedented frequency resolution, leading to discoveries of many rotationally split multiplets and reliable asymptotic period spacings. These two features are very useful in mode identification, owing to which the application of asteroseismology should be easier than in case of sdBV stars observed from the ground. During the K2 mission, thus far, we have found another 29 sdBV stars. The total sample of stars observed from space is now comparable with the one observed from the ground, though, the superior precision of the former is making them much more relevant for modeling purposes. We expect to find/observe more sdBV stars during the remaining Campaigns 17-19 of K2 mission."

The detection of the first transit of planetary objects orbiting a white dwarf came in the first campaign of K2 (Vanderburg et al. 2015), and likely signals just the beginning of new detections of an exciting class of planetary systems. Follow-up photometry (Croll et al. 2015, Gaensicke et al. 2016) and spectroscopy (Xu et al. 2016) show that the system is dynamic and changing on short (days to weeks) timescales. Our team is involved in the immediate follow-up, both photometrically (Gaensicke et al. 2016) and spectroscopically (Redfield et al. 2016, see Fig. 1). The transit of an Earth-sized planet would cause a full eclipse of the host star, and therefore would be easy to detect. However, the transits are very short, on the order of seconds to minutes.

K2 should detect 6–21 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in this sample during Cycle 6 (90% confidence using current SN rates [6], Poisson statistics, and including systematic uncertainties).

To take full advantage of the K2 SN Cosmology Experiment, we will photometrically follow all SN candidates with four telescopes: the 1.8-m Pan-STARRS (PS1), 1.5-m RATIR, 1-m Nickel and 1-m Swope. In combination, we will observe every K2 SN in 13 bands (uBVgrRiIzyYJH). The different sites/longitudes allow for improved cadence and mitigate against poor weather and telescope/instrument problems at a single site. Additionally, PS1 and the Swope telescope are particularly well-calibrated [12, 14, 19]. PS1 was used to discover ∼5000 high-z SNe and is currently used for the low-z Foundation survey (Foley et al., submitted). The Swope telescope was used for the Carnegie SN Project [3], which has also observed hundreds of SNe [5]. Observations on these well-calibrated systems will directly link the K2 SNe to thousands of other SNe observed on these systems.

Our program has 3 main goals. 1: we will provide the best distances to SNe Ia. This will allow us to improve K2 measurements of important physical parameters such as radii of the progenitor stars and to look for subtle correlations between K2 light curves and Hubble residuals. 2: we will use the K2 SNe Ia as a “Rosetta” sample, anchored to the PS1 system. As the K2 SNe will be observed by many telescopes, it is a rare opportunity to cross-calibrate all telescopes using SNe themselves. 3: we will monitor all newly discovered SNe at high cadence in multiple bands.

Likewise, understanding exoplanetary formation and habitability depends on accurate stellar ages. Stars lose angular momentum as they age, causing their rotation rates to slow over time (Skumanich 1972). Assuming stars are born with an initial distribution of rotation periods and gradually spin down, this angular momentum evolution provides a useful clock – a technique known as ""gyrochronology"". As the stars spin down the internal magnetic dynamo also diminishes; this process has been dubbed ""magnetochronology"". As rotation slows, decreased magnetic activity results in smaller starspot filling factors, lower levels of X-ray and UV emission, and decreased flare rates. Flares have been recently shown to decline as stars spin down. However, ~12% of flaring wide binaries in Kepler show differing levels of flare activity between components (Clarke & Davenport in Prep).

While stellar rotation is reliably recovered for many stars with Kepler/K2 (Aigrain et al. 2015), the accuracy of ages determined from these periods is debated, with typical uncertainties of ~1 Gyr. Furthermore, prescriptions for gyrochronology relations have been devised using a variety of calibrations, ranging from young open clusters at fixed ages (e.g. Barnes 2010, Meibom et al. 2011), to asteroseismology-based ages for solar mass stars (e.g. Angus 2015). None of these models yield reliable or uniform age estimates for stars at all ages and masses. Widely separated common proper motion binary stars provide a unique benchmark for testing these competing gyrochronology relations across all masses and ages, and for potentially creating an independent spin-down calibration. The range of rotation rates, ages and masses among the wide binaries selected for our study can populate the entire rotation-mass-age surface and help resolve the current disagreement between rotation and asteroseismology ages (cf. García et al. 2014; Barnes et al. 2016; dos Santos et al. 2016; Gonzales 2016; van Saders et al. 2016).

We are proposing for long cadence observations of ~180 wide binary systems (total 369 stars) with K2 Campaign 17, 18, and 19. Our study has three objectives: 1. Calibrate the stellar rotation–age paradigm using wide main sequence (MS) binaries, where components are coeval and have evolved independently; and 2. Quantify the flaring rate among the MS+MS binaries as a function of age. This dataset will build on our previous successful proposal for total ~1060 binaries from Campaign 5, 14, 15, as well as the ~200 systems in the original Kepler field. In total, we hope to create a publicly available catalog of wide binary systems at a range of masses and ages to calibrate evolution of the age-rotation–activity relation."

Most of them also show evidence of flaring activity in the long-cadence K2 light curves, and have significant UV excess. The low-cadence (30-minutes) of the K2 observations, however, does not allow the flaring behavior to be examined in detail; high cadence observations of these very active and flaring M dwarfs would reveal much more about the frequency of flaring events, and would allow one to correlate the flaring behavior with the observed changes in the spot patterns on those stars.

Our goal is to obtain a mass precision of 15%, the minimum value required to distinguish between compositional models.

This project requires new K2 data for two reasons. First, most transiting small planets detected by Kepler and K2 orbit stars too faint for RV observations, and some of the bright host stars are not amenable to RV observations because of the variability of the host star or the presence of nearby stars. Second, the anticipated number of small planets orbiting quiet, bright stars detected in K2 campaigns to date is small, and the properties of the systems to date do not adequately sample the desired range of planetary and stellar properties.

We propose a ranked list of 12,481 FGKM dwarf stars that are bright enough for RV follow-up and faint enough that they will not require unreasonably large K2 target apertures. We generated this list by first searching for all moderately bright stars that will be on silicon during Campaigns 17, 18, and 19, and then using the available photometry to remove likely giants and constrain the properties of the remaining dwarfs.

With major ramifications for the evolution theory of all spiral galaxies, the research will provide a self-consistent picture of the stellar age distribution for tens of thousands of stars in the Milky Way, revealing the first precise timeline for how the Galaxy formed and evolved. The proposal aims to achieve this by observing a sizable number of colour-magnitude selected oscillating red giants to probe the Galaxy using the fossil imprint in its stars far beyond the solar neighborhood. This is a continuing program running since Campaign-0 probing Galactic directions not probed before, taking full advantage of K2’s ‘360-degree view’ along the ecliptic. The high precision and 30-min sampling rate of K2 data are crucial for the project. No other current mission can provide data that will allow us to detect oscillations in large numbers of distant red giants."
GO19069,19,Heather,,Smith,KIPR NASA ARC,heather.d.smith@nasa.gov,,Neptune and Triton Atmospheric Dynamics,The scientific goals are to determine if the atmosphere/ surface irregular interactions on Neptune can be extrapolated from images taken by K2. If Triton is also in the image then we would also like to investigate the detection of and changes in the N2 atmosphere.
