%B We propose to observe a sample of chromospherically active stars in the K2 Campaign 17, 18, and 19 fields to expand upon a funded Cycle 3 program covering Campaign fields 8 and 10 (15-K2GO3 2-0040). Additional targets from follow-up proposals for this program were selected in Cycles 4 and 5 (Fields 11â€“15 as of this writing, Field 16 pending) for a total of 417 targets. The goal in observing these stars is to (1) search for planets around active stars that may show significant star-planet interaction (SPI) and be good transmission spectroscopy folllow-up candidates and (2) expand the active number of stars with detailed light curves to study their variability.
