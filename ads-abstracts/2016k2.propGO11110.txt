%B Thanks to its continuous monitoring and high photometric accuracy, Kepler/K2 might potentially provide unprecedented insights in the study of binary millisecond pulsar. In particular, in the past few years a new sub-class has been recognized in the "transitional" binary millisecond pulsars. These are millisecond pulsars in binary systems with a low-mass companion star, that are observed to swing between an accretion powered (X-ray pulsar) and a rotation powered (radio pulsar) state, and their recent discovery provided the conclusive evidence of the evolutionary link between these two classes of sources. Three transitional binary millisecond pulsars are known to date, and other potential members are recognized to be possibly hosted among the red-back and black-widow binaries, namely binary pulsars whose donor star is currently loosing mass. Enlarging the number of systems caught in this transitional phase is certainly needed to test binary evolution theories, and to study the disk-field interaction over a large range of mass accretion rates. 

Here we propose to exploit  the capabilities of Kepler/K2, and specifically ask to observe three targets Campaign 11: the globular cluster Terzan 5 (hosting several systems), the black-widow PSR J1731-1847, and the red-back PSR J1723-2837 (which are the only visible targets of this king in the K2 cycle 4 campaigns).  The three months long K2 campaign will lead to the most comprehensive study of optical aperiodic variability in these sources so far. Moreover, it will provide us with the unique opportunity to detect the 1-2 mag variations of the optical flux that is associated to transition between the radio pulsar (fainter) and the sub-luminous (brighter) disk state. We will then be able to determine (or provide more stringent constraints on) the still poorly understood timescales and dynamics of the state transitions of these puzzling systems.
