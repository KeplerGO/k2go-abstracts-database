%B Context and Goals. Recently Shibayama et al. (2013) showed that Kepler light curves of G-dwarf stars like the Sun reveal "superflares" with energies of at least 10^34 ergs, a hundred times more energetic than the strongest known solar flare (e.g. Carrington 1859). This implies that the Sun itself might also produce such flares, dramatically affecting the Earth.

Although those superflaring stars not in binaries are clearly solar-like, unlike the Sun they tend to be rapid rotators (Notsu et al. 2015ab). Since they are bright and lie in the Kepler field near the Galactic plane, they could be young enough (< 1 Gyr) to retain a strong global dynamo, the suggested cause of the strong flaring. This would imply that stars as old as the Sun, 4.5 Gyr, should not undergo superflares, since the global dynamo has spun down due to magnetic braking. In contrast, Brandenburg et al. (2012) review how solar magnetic fields are generated in local small-scale dynamos via turbulence associated with convective motions, which may cause superflares in relatively inactive G stars (Candelaresi et al. 2014).

In this work, our goals are to establish whether the Sun could undergo a superflare, and whether local dynamos might generate such flaring. We will clarify the above aspects by establishing the characteristics of flaring and sunspots in G dwarf stars at least as old as the Sun. To this end we propose to obtain long-cadence Kepler 2 light curves in the halo field C12 of 987 G dwarfs with Kepler magnitudes from 16.8 to 18.5, located up to 1 kpc above the Galactic plane. The G dwarf light curves proposed here complement those of 1200 old K dwarfs we have already targeted in Stripe 82 in the K2 halo field C8. The large sample is required because superflares are rare events: Candelaresi et al. report a rate of 8 per 10^4 days per 100K for mid-K to late G dwarfs, implying detection of only ~80 GK-dwarf superflares during the K2 span of ~80 days.

All stars have at least ten observations of SDSS ugriz photometry, spread sporadically over more than a decade. Because flares are brightest in the blue and near-UV, this record can constrain the previous history of flaring in each star from the variation of the u magnitude versus the near-simultaneous griz magnitudes. In addition, Keck/DEIMOS follow-up spectroscopy of the flaring stars, covering 6450  9150 Å at 1.2 Å resolution (R ~ 6500), is anticipated during twilight hours in time granted for the faint giants of Andromeda (Gilbert et al. 2014). This will provide radial velocities, metallicity, and light-element to iron abundance ratios, helpful in discriminating old from young populations. We will explore trends in flaring with temperature and activity level across the entire G-K dwarf domain, and provide a catalog listing all stars showing flares that includes their stellar parameters and activity history.

Methods. Following Shibayama et al., we will find superflares from their rapid rise and subsequent slower decay, and estimate the flare energy from the maximum level relative to the background photosphere. Periodic eclipses or ellipsoidal variations will reveal stars in close binaries (Prsa et al. 2011). Sunspots and rotation periods will be detected from quasi-periodic variations using the methods of Nielsen et al. (2013), but adapted to the 80-day period. Flaring models will be updated.

Relevance. Kepler 2 is the only means currently available that is capable of obtaining light curves of sufficient sensitivity on large numbers of faint dwarfs. GK dwarfs with 16.8 < Kp < 18.5 in the halo field C12, at Galactic latitude b = 60º, are located > 1 kpc above the Galactic plane, and therefore are old stars like the Sun. Due to the low Galactic latitude of the original Kepler field, b = +13.5º, and a mean Kp ~ 14.5, the G dwarfs with superflare detections lie only ~250pc above the plane. The K2 high-latitude fields C1, C3, C6, C8, and C10 contain very few suitable faint G-type stellar targets.
