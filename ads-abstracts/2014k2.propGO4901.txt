%B We propose a pilot study to perform K2 photometry on bright (Kp < 5.5) targets using a small number of unsaturated pixels. The test will be performed on nine 3–5 mag B-stars and red giants in the Pleiades and Hyades open clusters, at a pixel cost equivalent to ∼48 12th mag stars. If successful, this technique will open an unprecedented window for K2 to study the interiors of bright stars with exceptionally well determined fundamental properties.
