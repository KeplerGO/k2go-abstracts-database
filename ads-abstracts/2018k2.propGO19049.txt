%B We propose large, magnitude-limited samples of FGKM dwarfs for long-cadence K2 observations. These samples will enable planet searches and complement our magnitude-limited samples in previous Campaigns. As with the previous fields, our team will construct robust catalogs of planets buttressed by detailed examinations of light curves, high-resolution spectroscopy, and adaptive optics imaging. We emphasize specifically in this proposal stars that were observed in previous K2 Campaigns that can be observed again in Campaigns 17â€“19. Second visits for these stars will increase our search sensitivity, particularly for longer-period planets, and enable comparisons of planet occurrence in different regions of the Milky Way.
