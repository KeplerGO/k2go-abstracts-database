%B The K2 mission provides the opportunity to search for transiting planets orbiting tens of thousands of nearby cool dwarfs. We propose to continue our successful K2 M Dwarf Project (K2-MDP) by acquiring long cadence observations of 8287 cool dwarfs in the campaign 17–19 fields. We anticipate that we will detect 100–200 small planets around late-type stars from the full K2-MDP. Many of these worlds will be smaller than 2R and some might even be habitable. Our observations will increase the number of known M dwarf planetary systems; improve estimates of planet occurrence rates; inform theories of planet formation, evolution, interiors, and atmospheres; and provide new targets for follow-up observations with current and future observatories.
