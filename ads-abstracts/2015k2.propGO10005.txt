%B We propose to measure the  long and short cadence light curves of the archetypal quasar 3C273 and to measure the long cadence light curves of a large statistically complete sample of 185 quasars drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and of 65 bright quasars drawn from other surveys in Fields 8 and 10. The first goal is to characterize the variability of 3C 273 on timescales from minutes to months using continuous observations for 75 days, which has never been done before. Our  second goal is to determine the origin of optical emission in the quasars at the time of K2 observations. The three candidate origins are: 1) a single dominant synchrotron-emitting region in a jet; 2) multiple synchrotron-emitting regions in a jet; and 3) an accretion disk (AD) with one or more thermal emitting regions. Our third  goal is to see how the optical variability amplitude and power spectral densities (PSDs) of the three main classes of quasars --blazars, radio-loud quasars, and radio-quiet quasars --differ on minute-to-months timescales. The candidate origins for optical emission from radio-loud quasars are the same as those for blazars, but without enhanced relativistic beaming in the jet. Optical variations in radio-quiet quasars may originate in an AD with multiple thermal emission regions. We will measure the PSDs of the light curves and determine the PSD slopes which are related to the underlying variability processes, such as turbulence in the relativistic jets or stochastic fluctuations in thermal emission from segments of the AD.
