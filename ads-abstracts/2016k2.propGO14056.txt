%B We propose to observe select bright M dwarfs with K2 in Campaigns 14 and 16, drawing extensively from the target list for the upcoming NIR Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF) radial velocity spectrograph at the 10m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), supplemented with targets from SDSS-APOGEE and GAIA, and prioritizing targets from prior K2 fields which will overlap with TESS observations. Rotationally induced radial velocity noise can masquerade as a low mass exoplanet. K2 photometry of these targets will uncover the rotational periods and levels of activity, directly enabling more correct interpretation of the RV signals and the discovery of exoplanets. HPF starts its science observations in 2017, and of particular interest is the forward facing Campaign 16, where the power of the HET queue-scheduled observations enables HPF to acquire spectra and RVs on a number of bright M dwarfs simultaneously with K2 photometry, enabling techniques like FF' and Gaussian Processes to be brought to bear on the continuous photometry+RV data set. The goal of this project is directly in line with NASA and community goals of detection of low mass exoplanets in or near Habitable Zones of our nearest neighbors, and with Decadal Recommendations of using precision RVs to detect and characterize low mass planets.
