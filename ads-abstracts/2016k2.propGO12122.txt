%B Our team is searching for transiting planets orbiting FGK dwarf stars in all of the K2 fields.  The first of our three objectives is construct catalogs of transiting planets in the magnitude-limited samples of K2 fields.  These catalogs enable diverse follow-up observations and analyses by our team and others.  Second, we aim to discover small planets suitable for high-precision Doppler spectroscopy with Keck-HIRES and other instruments.  Measuring the planets masses will significantly refine our knowledge of the variation of planet density, composition, and atmospheric extent with planet size.  Our third goal is to use the planet catalogs to measure variations in the occurrence rate of planets as a function of sky position, sampling different star formation environments and stellar densities. We will learn whether our detailed occurrence measurements from the prime Kepler Mission (Howard et al. 2012, Petigura et al. 2013, Sanchis-Ojeda et al. 2014) can be applied directly to the solar neighborhood. We already see differences between the populations of planets orbiting nearby stars and stars in the prime Kepler Field.  For example, hot Jupiters are 2.5 times less abundant in the Kepler Field (Howard et al. 2012).  We have to wonder if the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the Habitable Zone (Petigura et al. 2013) is similarly reduced relative to nearby stars. With this proposal we will measure the occurrence of detectable, short-period super-Earths and Neptune-size planets (~2-3 Earth-radii). 

This Cycle 4 request for Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 is similar to our previous K2 Guest Observer proposals in C0-C10 (PIs Howard, Sanchis-Ojeda, Petigura, and Winn) that constitute the primary sample of the bright FGK dwarf stars observed by K2.  We select stars from the provisional TESS Dwarf Star Catalog (TDC), which combines 2MASS, Tycho-2, UCAC4, and other catalogs.  Giant stars were cleansed using reduced proper motion cuts.  Here we request magnitude-limited samples (Kp < 14) of Fields 11-13 comprising approximately 10,000 stars per field.

We will continue our search for transit signals in the K2 photometry using the well-vetted TERRA pipeline (Petigura & Marcy 2012, Petigura et al. 2013).  We catalog the planets discovered, their orbital and physical properties, and their host star characteristics.  We compute the occurrence rates of small, close-in planets using injection-and-recovery tests to account for the sensitivity of TERRA and will report the field-to-field variability and overall rates of planet occurrence. Assuming a precision of 80 ppm over 6.5 hours, a 2 Earth-radii planet with P = 20-day is detectable at SNR = 8 during a single 75-day K2 campaign.  Based on the prime mission occurrence statistics, we expect to find 3 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with P < 20 days per 1,000 stars observed. As validated by our searches of K2 photometry from Campaigns 0-2, a sample of 8,000 stars is expected to yield ~25 planets of size 2-3 Earth-radii with orbital periods less than 20 days, providing an occurrence measurement with 25% fractional uncertainty. With 8,000 stars, we will be sensitive to factor-of-two variations in the occurrence rate of 2-3 Earth-radii planets at 4-sigma significance.  In addition, we will identify the planets most amenable to Doppler mass measurements and observe them using Keck-HIRES and other facilities. These mass measurements will focus on detectable small planets -- short-period super-Earths and Neptunes and ultra-short-period Earths. Our team demonstrated technical expertise in all of the above areas during the prime Kepler mission.
