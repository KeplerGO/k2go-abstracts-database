%B It is proposed that the confirmed exoplanet systems that cross over into the fields of view of the K2 C16 and C18 campaigns be observed in long cadence by the Kepler spacecraft. Twelve (12) targets were identified using the K2 Office's k2fov package, and nine (9) of these targets were previously observed in C5 as well.
