%B We propose to use the Kepler telescope to detect small transiting planets, particularly those orbiting stars amenable to radial velocity (RV) follow-up. To this end we provide a catalog of 32,300 stars in fields 4 and 5, selected by virtue of planet detectability.  Our catalog of late F, G and K dwarf stars with bright Kepler magnitudes is based on the draft TESS target catalog, and provides the best targets for both transit searching and follow-up observations.
