%B We propose to obtain the first short-cadence K2 observations a classical nova: V5558 Sgr erupted in 2007 and is a very rare example of a thermonuclear runaway on a low-mass white dwarf. The K2 observations will be used to determine its orbital period, to constrain the binary parameter, and to probe the re-start of mass transfer following the nova eruption.
