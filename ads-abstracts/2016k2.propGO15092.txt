%B We propose to use K2 to observe evolved stars in a primitive stellar system: NGC 5897, a metal-poor globular cluster in the Galactic halo that will be in Field 15. Previous work with Kepler has demonstrated  asteroseismology as an important tool for investigating stellar evolution (e.g., Chaplin & Miglio 2013).  We will apply these methods to stars that have evolved past the main sequence, to red giant stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and known variable stars in NGC 5897.  During the AGB phase of stellar evolution, in particular, a star sheds most of its mass, driven by long-period pulsations.  While the broad outline is understood, the details of the processes remain murky.  Results from Kepler and CoRoT for AGB stars suggest that their long periods (100's of days) may be tied to the very short periods (i.e., ~seconds and minutes) to which K2 is sensitive (e.g., Mosser et al. 2013).  However, those were field stars, where many important stellar parameters are unknown.  For a globular cluster, in contrast, the distance, metallicity, age, etc. are typically known.  Thus, we can investigate our targets with few assumptions needed to constrain the asteroseismology models.  At [Fe/H] ~ -2.0, NGC 5897 has a lower metallicity than the two globular clusters previously targeted with K2. Thus, it will provide an important connection to metal-poor systems in the high red-shift Universe. The high-frequency oscillations detectable only with K2 can help determine stellar parameters such as surface gravity, mass, radius, which are otherwise hard to deduce for evolved stars.  We will investigate how these properties change during the campaign, i.e., how their derived characteristics change as a function of phase of the longer pulsation periods of the giant branch stars.  NGC 5897 also contains several RR Lyrae variables, evolved stars which have much shorter periods. These kinds of evolved stars provide an important rung in the distance ladder, so understanding how their properties depend on metallicity is vital. We will combine these observations with photometric and spectroscopic data from our on-going project to study evolved stars in these kinds of stellar systems.
