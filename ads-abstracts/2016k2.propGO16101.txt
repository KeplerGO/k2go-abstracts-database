%B Upcoming K2 fields will overlap to some degree with previously
observed fields.  We propose short-cadence observations of a
collection of transiting planet candidates that we have identified in
the earlier K2 data.  The better time sampling will allow for improved
characterization of the transit signals, and better discrimination
between true planets and imposters. In some cases the finer time
sampling may also allow the stellar obliquity to be determined through
the analysis of starspot-crossing anomalies.
