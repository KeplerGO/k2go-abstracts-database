%B We propose short-cadence observations in K2 Field 10 of four candidate pulsating white dwarfs and two known remnant planetary systems. These DDT observations supplement our GO proposal; two of these targets have new spectroscopy putting the stars within 250 K of the empirical instability strip, and we now propose two faint targets having seen the success of K2 with Kp âˆ¼19.0 stars.
