%B Through comparing the characteristics and demographics of exoplanets of different ages, we aim to directly constrain the timescales for planetary migration and evolution. The K2 mission has contributed all of the confirmed transiting exoplanets in sub-Gyr clusters, including six in the Praesepe cluster (M44; τ ≈ 800 Myr). Some of these planets are anomalously large, perhaps owing to ongoing radius evolution. Moreover, no transiting hot Jupiter has yet been detected from K2 observations of thousands of young stars (<1 Gyr), despite being easily detectable from K2 data; this raises questions about whether the prevalence of these planets is different in young populations (due to e.g. continuing orbital migration). The young transiting planets discovered by K2 will form the foundation for comparative exoplanet studies that isolate time as the key parameter of interest. K2 Campaign 18 observations of the Praesepe cluster will extend the observational baseline to >140 d for 1030 members, and to >210 d for up to 483 members. The combined data for Praesepe will thus be sensitive to planets at longer periods, compared to other young clusters observed by K2. The K2 Praesepe data will also be a legacy data set from which a range of other astrophysics can be investigated, including angular momentum evolution, starspot lifetimes, differential rotation, and stellar multiplicity.
