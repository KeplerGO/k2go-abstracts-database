%B White dwarfs (WDs) teach us about the final evolutionary stages of stars and their planetary systems, during which a significant fraction of the stellar envelope is lost. Previously, the majority of WDs were assumed to be photometrically stable and often used as calibration standards. Kepler has now shown that 30 âˆ’ 50% of WDs are in fact variable. Such behaviour can reveal the presence of hitherto unseen brown dwarf (BD), degenerate, and potentially planetary companions, surface magnetic star-spots, evidence for accretion, and provide WD rotation rates.
