%B We propose to combine data from K2 ’s C5, C16, and C18 with ground-based light curves obtained by PTF and HATNet (Kovács et al. 2014) to examine activity cycles in >1100 Praesepe stars. To our knowledge, there has been no large-scale attempt to revisit P rot measurements for open-cluster stars, and our observations will provide valuable insight into the stability of starspot distributions and magnetic-field structures over baselines of weeks to a decade.
