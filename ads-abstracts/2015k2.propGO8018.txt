%B We propose observations of variable white dwarfs in Fields 8 & 10 of the K2 mission. We propose short-cadence observations of known and high-probability pulsating white dwarfs within the empirical DAV instability strip. We additionally propose observations of known magnetic and convective-atmosphere white dwarfs to constrain magnetic activity in these stars.

As they cool, white dwarf stars with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres pulsate as DAVs (a.k.a. ZZ Ceti stars) when they reach the appropriate effective temperature to foster a hydrogen partial-ionization zone, which efficiently drives global oscillations. This range of temperatures empirically spans roughly 12,600-11,100 K for typical-mass (0.6 Msun), log g = 8.0 white dwarfs (Gianninas et al. 2011, ApJ, 743, 138). Pulsating white dwarfs provide an important glimpse into the interior of the future of the vast majority (> 97%) of all stars in our Galaxy, including our Sun, allowing us to probe the masses and compositions of their electron-degenerate cores, as well as of their non-degenerate envelopes; to determine their internal rotation profiles; and to detect weak magnetic fields (see reviews by Winget & Kepler 2008 (ARA&A, 46, 157) and Fontaine & Brassard 2008 (PASP, 120, 1043).

Since the DAV instability strip is defined by temperature, color selection is an excellent predictor of variability. Our team discovered all DAVs in the original Kepler mission, which has led to exquisite insight into white dwarf interiors. We have applied the same photometric selection methods to K2 Fields 8 & 10 using the SDSS, and have identified 15 excellent candidate white dwarfs on silicon in each field with colors consistent with the empirical DAV instability strip. Additionally, there are five previously known, confirmed pulsating white dwarfs in Field 8 (SDSS J0052-0051, GD 842, SDSS J1112+0009, WD J0050-0023, WD J0111+0018) and three in Field 10 (PG 1159-035, WD J1200-0251, and WD J1244-0221). Notably, PG1159-035 (V=15.0 mag) was the subject of one of the first Whole Earth Telescope runs -- a coordinated global multi-site campaign in 1989 March (Winget et al. 1991, ApJ, 378, 326) -- and is one of the best-studied and richest pulsating white dwarfs known.

Every new pulsating white dwarf we can observe with Kepler adds value, since it brings us that much closer to statistically significant studies of white dwarfs with ensemble asteroseismology (e.g. Chaplin et al. 2011, Science, 332, 213). With typical pulsations ranging from 100-1400 s, we require short-cadence observations of these white dwarfs. Minute-cadence K2 observations have the added benefit of catching transits/eclipses of the white dwarf, revealing any unresolved double-degenerate binaries or even planetary companions.

Additionally, we propose observations of multiple convective and/or possibly magnetic white dwarfs in Fields 8 and 10 to carry out the first in-depth study into the magnetic activity of the endpoints of stellar evolution. These long-baseline photometric observations will test white dwarf variability on a large scale and in a completely new regime.
