%B The scientific goal of this proposal is to determine the diversity in age among K dwarfs located ~1kpc above the Galactic plane. Youthful members are revealed from semi-periodic brightness variations of up to 1% caused by sunspots rotating across the stellar disk. In open clusters aged 1 Gyr or less, single GK dwarfs have rotational periods of ≥10 days, but in open clusters several Gyr old, their periods exceed 20 days. The proposed K2 light curves are for field K dwarfs with Kepler magnitudes 16.5/17.0 < Kp < 18.6 in C17 and C19, both at galactic latitude b ~ 60°. They will show to what extent binaries and young stars are present among the main-sequence stars at the above heights, constraining scenarios of the formation of the disk populations of the Galaxy.
