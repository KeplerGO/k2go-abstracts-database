%B We propose observations of known and suspected variable white dwarfs in Fields 4 & 5 of the K2 mission. We propose short-cadence observations of pulsating WDs within the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip, which will allow unprecedented insight into the interiors of these stellar remnants. We also propose short-cadence observations of several unique post-common-envelope binaries that are known to exhibit eclipses, including the brightest such system known, V471 Tau. Finally, we propose short- and long-cadence observations of known strongly magnetic white dwarfs to constrain magnetic activity and rotation rates in these stars.
