%B The origins, physical mechanisms, and variety of supernovae (SNe) and other explosive transients remain shrouded in mystery. The continuous 30 minute cadence of K2 will provide critical early time data, probing a window that is inaccessible to traditional ground-based SN surveys. We propose a Large K2 Program to monitor roughly 15,000 bright galaxies in each of Campaigns C17, C18, and C19, which should yield, in total, more than 40 SNe light curves. In the Kepler GO programs, we identified 3 SN Ia (Olling et al. 2015), 2 SN IIP (Garnavich et al. 2016; Tucker et al., submitted), and 1 SN IIn/Ia-csm (Garnavich et al., in prep.). We also discovered several galaxies displaying AGN activity with variability at >0.01% level (Shaya et al 2015). In recent K2 Campaigns, we identified more than 15 SNe, 5 of which were spectroscopically classified. With the lightcurves of unprecedented precision and completeness from this program, we plan to a) determine the types of companions to progenitors of SNe using features in the early breakout (t<4 days) LCs; b) explore the explosion physics of SN, especially SN Ia, using subtle features during their rise (t<10 days); c) improve the calibration of SN Ia as a standard candle for measuring distances, H 0 , and dark energy; and d) also add significantly to the virtually unexplored very low-Eddington regime of AGN. We have coordinated a major, concurrent photometric and spectroscopic follow up campaign, including space-based observatories (HST, Spitzer, Swift) as well as large (e.g. Keck, Gemini, DECam) and small aperture (e.g., SkyMapper, PS1, ATLAS, ZTF, ASAS-SN, LCOGT) ground-based follow-up.
