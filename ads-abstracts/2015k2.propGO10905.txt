%B We propose short-cadence observations of the unique, hot-subdwarf post common envelope binary system HW Vir, a prototype of detached eclipsing binaries comprising of a hot subdwarf B primary and a cool M-dwarf, in order to pin down the current orbital period variations and confirm the presence of the proposed circumbinary planets.
