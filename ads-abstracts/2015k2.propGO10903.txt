%B The F9V star HD 106516 has 37 years of MWO observations, providing an excellent record of the dynamo output via the S-index. New Kepler K2 observations of this star would provide significantly improved characterization of its dynamo inputs – rotation, mass, radius, and age – making this target a useful benchmark for dynamo studies.
