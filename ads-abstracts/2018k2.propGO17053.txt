%B The K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment will observe >∼ 10 galaxies with 30-minute cadence to discover and follow supernova (SN) candidates. We have selected 9,437 "ideal" galaxies that will fall on silicon for Campaigns 17/19. This is in addition to our ∼6000 galaxies selected for Campaign 16. K2 should detect 6–21 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in this sample during Cycle 6 (90% confidence using current SN rates [6], Poisson statistics, and including systematic uncertainties).

To take full advantage of the K2 SN Cosmology Experiment, we will photometrically follow all SN candidates with four telescopes: the 1.8-m Pan-STARRS (PS1), 1.5-m RATIR, 1-m Nickel and 1-m Swope. In combination, we will observe every K2 SN in 13 bands (uBVgrRiIzyYJH). The different sites/longitudes allow for improved cadence and mitigate against poor weather and telescope/instrument problems at a single site. Additionally, PS1 and the Swope telescope are particularly well-calibrated [12, 14, 19]. PS1 was used to discover ∼5000 high-z SNe and is currently used for the low-z Foundation survey (Foley et al., submitted). The Swope telescope was used for the Carnegie SN Project [3], which has also observed hundreds of SNe [5]. Observations on these well-calibrated systems will directly link the K2 SNe to thousands of other SNe observed on these systems.

Our program has 3 main goals. 1: we will provide the best distances to SNe Ia. This will allow us to improve K2 measurements of important physical parameters such as radii of the progenitor stars and to look for subtle correlations between K2 light curves and Hubble residuals. 2: we will use the K2 SNe Ia as a “Rosetta” sample, anchored to the PS1 system. As the K2 SNe will be observed by many telescopes, it is a rare opportunity to cross-calibrate all telescopes using SNe themselves. 3: we will monitor all newly discovered SNe at high cadence in multiple bands. Our 13 filters span effective wavelengths of 350–1635 nm. Our filtered observations at these early times will provide important color information to complement the K2 light curves.
