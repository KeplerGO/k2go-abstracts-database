%B We propose to observe AGNs in Campaign 6.  This field is ideal for extragalactic observations.  Targets will be selected to maximize the fraction of photons in the Kepler band that were emitted from the inner accretion disk. Our major motivation is to search in the power spectra for the analogs of the stable high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in ~8 stellar mass black hole X-ray binaries and one superluminous (~400 solar mass black hole?) X-ray source. The origin of these QPOs is still a mystery, as is the claim (Remillard) that the two highest frequencies are often in a ratio of 3/2. However, they have the potential of providing a clock very close to the horizon (especially for the many black holes with close to maximum angular momentum). Only one (low-frequency) QPO has been seen (in X-rays) in an AGN. However, the continuum power spectra can also provide valuable information about conditions there, as has been demonstrated by the Kepler observations of Edelson et al. and Revalski et al. 
  Using realistic models of accretion disks and photon orbits in the Kerr metric, Levine (as part of his senior thesis) and Wagoner have calculated this fraction from a region where the most robust normal mode could exist, as a function of red shift, black hole mass, spin, and disk inclination. We will consider those AGNs that appear to have luminosities close to the Eddington limit. These calculations will be a major input to our target selection. As an example, the period of this (g-) mode, which is gravitationally trapped near the temperature maximum of the disk, is (11  40) (M/10^8 solar masses) (1+Z) hours (for maximum  zero spin). Large redshifts (Z) are required, since the maximum temperature of the disk is ~ 10^5 K for 10^8 solar masses. We will be employing the 30-minute cadence of Kepler, giving us about 3800 observations. This will be a Small Investigation, with < 100 targets. 
  We plan to involve high school students taught by Caroline Odden in this research. We believe this project will serve as a highly engaging STEM activity for these high school students. Odden teaches an astronomy research course at Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts.
