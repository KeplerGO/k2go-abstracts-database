%B Accretion occurs on vast physical scales in the universe. From from the accretion discs which power active galactic nuclei (parsecs), proto-planetary discs around young stellar objects (several AU) and the discs around accreting neutron stars or white dwarfs (few thousand km), the flow of material and angular momentum is governed by the same underlying physical processes. The timescales involved scale as R^2 (where R is the disc radius), so span a vast range. For this reason, the accretion flows around white dwarfs are the ideal laboratories for investigating model disc structure, the effects of accretion rate variations, and accretion flows along magnetic field lines, as the equivalent variations in larger discs cannot be studied in human lifetimes.

Accreting white dwarfs (cataclysmic variables, CVs) display variability on a wide range of timescales, e.g. accretion disc flickering (seconds), white dwarf spin (seconds), eclipses (minutes), white dwarf pulsations (minutes), the orbital period (hours) and precession of the accretion disc (days). The capability of K2 (and the original Kepler mission) to provide uninterrupted, high precision, high cadence photometry over a long baseline is unique, and allows us to sample the variability over a range of timescales that is not possible with ground-based observations. K2 has the additional advantage that it allows us to study a more diverse and representative population of accreting binaries than was possible in the single, fixed Kepler field. The resulting library of high quality light curves from K2 will provide a diverse, representative observational sample from which to investigate disc-based phenomena.
