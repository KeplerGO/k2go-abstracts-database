%B Regarding to the observational modes and instrumentation constraints, the detection and photometry of moons of outer giant planets highly resemble to those of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) due to their remoteness. As we presented in our recent study (Pal et al. 2015), by involving precise and fine-tuned algorithms the Kepler/K2 mission is indeed capable to perform photometry of TNOs with scientifically relevant quality down to the faint limit of R=23 magnitudes. In addition, we also demonstrated that the essential physical quantities regarding to the rotational characteristics can be resolved using only a few hundreds of pixels like in the case of 2002 GV31 if observation masks are focused at the stationary point of the given object. These physical quantities, including the rotation period, flux amplitude and the presence of a double-peaked light variations can then further constrain the theories of the formation and origin of these objects and hence those of Solar System.

In order to exploit these unique capabilities of the Kepler/K2 mission regarding to Solar System studies, here we propose to observe four members of the outer Uranian satellite system, namely Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero and Setebos. According to former observations, database information and predictions, two out of these objects (Caliban and Sycorax, see the table below) are bright enough to safely observe using our earlier implementations for Kepler/K2 + TNO photometric pipelines. The two another targets (Prospero and Setebos) are predicted to be somewhat fainter than our detections for 2002 GV31. However, the lack of background sources (the Uranian system can be seen throughout Cycle 8 far off from the plane of the Milky way), and the low inclination which yield direct apparent turnbacks instead of a loop (see e.g. the case of 2007 JJ43) could yield optimal masks with a lesser number of pixels. In our proposal, we mark these two fainter targets as ``Priority 2'' since one can only extrapolate that these two can successfully be detected and there is no available confirmation in the literature. Therefore, upon a successful data reduction, rather faint detections of moving objects can also be pushing the limits of the Kepler/K2 mission.

According to the current stage of mission planning regarding to K2/Cycle 8, all of the the proposed targets will fall on silicon. In addition, the saturation trails of Uranus will avoid these moving targets, and even the closest satellite (Caliban) will be outside the expected reflection halos.

In addition, one of these satellites, Sycorax has clearly been detected in far infrared by employing the PACS detector of the Herschel Space Observatory in the framework of the ``TNO's are Cool!'' open time key programme (Lellouch et al. 2013). Therefore, the combination of thermal emission data with the accurate photometric data series reflecting the physical rotation properties of this body can lead to a fairly comprehensive and unique view to this object -- which would be the first such observation in the context of outer irregular satellites.
