%B Despite the detection and orbital characterization of several hundred short period comets to date, only a very small number have had their rotational properties fully determined. This is principally a consequence of their intrinsic faintness for the majority of their orbits, and the acute difficulty in securing long baseline and consistently accurate observations on the largest of ground based optical/IR telescopes to sufficiently sample ~ 4 to 40 hour periods (the approximate range of the currently known sample for which rotational data exists). The K2 mission however offers an ideal platform to study any sufficiently bright short period comets that serendipitously pass through each of the planned Cycle 4 Campaign fields - K2's unparalleled photometric sensitivity combined with its ~ 70 day observational baseline represents a unique observational opportunity to study these mysterious and compelling objects. Using both the K2ephem tool and JPL's HORIZON facility, we identified 15 short period comets that pass within the campaign fields with predicted magnitudes < 22 - 13 are Jupiter Family Comets (JFC), one is a Main Belt Comet (MBC) and one is a Centaur. Of the 11 located > 3 AU (including the MBC/`active asteroid' 176P/LINEAR), K2's  precision photometry will allow us to accurately characterize their nucleus rotation periods. For the remaining 4 comets within 3 AU that are expected to be active, full coverage of their passage across K2's field of view will yield a unique temporal profile of nucleus activity, in addition to a rotational period. These data will be immediately pertinent to our understanding of cometary nucleus density and structure (of great relevance in the assessment of viable NEO mitigation strategies), the relationship between rotation & activity, links between JFCs and Kuiper Belt Objects and their formation, and complement extensive campaigns to date to study size, albedo and color properties. Furthermore, accurate spin state data could be used in the selection and subsequent planning of any future NASA missions to these 'time capsules' of the early solar system.
