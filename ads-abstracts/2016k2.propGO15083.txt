%B The Discovery and Validation of K2 Exoplanets (DAVE) team proposes to provide the Astronomical community with a catalog of well-vetted exoplanets discovered using data from the K2 mission, along with comprehensive vetting forms. We propose the observation of approximately 9,000 bright, dwarf stars, over campaigns 14, 15, and 16, which is expected to yield at least 150 transiting exoplanets, most of them suitable for follow-up by JWST and other facilities. We will produce publicly accessible dispositions and vetting forms for every planet candidate detection by DAVE and all other teams. Utilizing our group's extensive experience in vetting exoplanets discovered during the Kepler and K2 missions, we will employ a mixture of robotic and human vetting to thoroughly vet these candidates and eliminate many different types of false positives. This proposal utilizes the unique capabilities of the K2 mission, including its extreme photometric precision and continuous 75-day observing range. This proposal directly contributes towards NASA's Astrophysics Division's science goal to "Discover and study planets around other stars, and explore whether they could harbor life." It also contributes to the K2 solicitation goal of addressing compelling scientific questions in the field of stellar astrophysics.
