%B The K2 mission observes fields along the ecliptic; these fields range from -70 to 70-deg in galactic latitudes, thus probing inherently different parts of our Galaxy. These parts (the bulge, thick disk, thin disk, halo) feature distinct stellar populations, and understanding the properties of those populations is an ongoing effort. Studying these properties relies on reliable fundamental parameters of stars: their masses, radii, temperatures and luminosities. Eclipsing binary stars lend themselves naturally to this task, since their favorable geometrical orientation and basic laws of gravity enable us to determine fundamental parameters to a ~1% accuracy. We scoured the published catalogs and proprietary KELT and SuperWASP data for all eclipsing binary stars in K2 C14, C15 and C16 fields. We propose to observe these stars and, along with other serendipitous discoveries of binarity in the fields, build a stellar population model based on the fundamental parameters derived from K2 data and follow-up multi-color photometry and spectroscopy. Studying the intrinsic differences in stellar populations across K2 fields will allow us to infer the dependence on galactic latitude and contribute to our understanding of stellar population distribution in our Galaxy.
