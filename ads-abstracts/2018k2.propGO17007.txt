%B We propose to continue our highly successful and productive programme to study Cataclysmic Variables using Kepler and K2. Our primary goal is to obtain a better understanding of the physical processes occuring when an accretion disc goes into outburst and how the disc behaves during quiescence. We have identified four CVs in fields 17â€“19.
