%B We propose to observe 32 evolved carbon stars in the long-cadence mode in K2 fields F17, F18, and F19. Stars which have evolved beyond the main sequence can vary on a wide range of timescales, from a few hours to hundreds of days, even in the same star. K2â€™s 80-day observing window and its 29-minute sample rate make it ideal for investigating these variations. However, most previous Kepler and K2 observations of evolved stars have concentrated on oxygen-rich samples [e.g., 1, 2], probably because they outnumber the carbon stars, at least in the Milky Way. Carbon stars, though, may be responsible for at least half the dust returned to the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) [e.g., 10, 5], and may even dominate dust production in the early Universe [e.g., 21, 8]. To investigate this important population, we recently acquired K2 observations of evolved carbon stars. While we are still analyzing those data, we are, indeed, finding variations on the order of a few hours to tens of days. However, those stars were primarily in the Galactic plane and suffer from crowding effects. The next set of K2 fields, most likely the last, contain more than thirty known carbon stars that are toward the bulge and halo. With these new data, we will significantly expand the sample of this important population with high quality K2 data. With a robust sample of carbon stars, we can also test asteroseismologic techniques and models that have been developed for oxygen-rich stars [e.g., 4], potentially determining parameters like mass, radius, and surface gravity, independent of their unknown distances.
