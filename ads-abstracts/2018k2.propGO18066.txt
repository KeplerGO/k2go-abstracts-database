%B We propose to observe several well-studied, nearby, main sequence binary systems as fundamental astrophysical calibrators. We specifically target either: 1) systems where oscillations should be detectable in the primary star and the secondary star is of M spectral type, and 2) binaries where both primary and secondary stars should be detectable in solar-like oscillations. These systems are fundamental anchors where binary analysis, astrometry, asteroseismology, and rotation-based stellar characterization methods—particularly for age inference— can be tested, unified, and placed on internally consistent grounds.
