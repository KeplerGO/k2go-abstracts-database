%B We propose V2487 Oph as a short-cadence target for K2 during Field 9. For 1-minute short-cadence integrations on the V=17.5 star in quiescence, the uncertainty will be ~0.02 mag. The reason for the short-cadence is that V2487 Oph is known to continually display variations of >0.1 mag on time scales of ten minutes, and because we expect variations from eclipses or white dwarf spins to be much faster than 30-minutes.
