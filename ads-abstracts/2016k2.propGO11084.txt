%B The Population III stars are still eluding discovery. The first stars and their immediate successors are predicted to have formed within the first 300 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to redshifts z>15. To date, there are no spectroscopically confirmed galaxies or gamma-ray bursts with z>9 (Zitrin et al. 2015). The best hope for finding any first star may therefore be to find a stellar relic lurking in our Galactic backyard. 

According to cosmological models, the very first stars formed in the centers of the largest and most over-dense dark matter mini-halos, which subsequently accreted material to become the inner regions of large galaxies (e.g. Greif et al. 2012). The oldest stars should thus typically reside today in the bulges of galaxies like the Milky Way: metal-poor bulge stars are predicted to have typical formation redshifts of z>10 (Salvadori et al. 2010). Indeed, of the bulge stars with [Fe/H]<-3, approximately 15% should have formed at z>15 (Tumlinson 2010), an otherwise completely inaccessible cosmic period. These stars thus provide a unique insight to one of the hottest topics in contemporary cosmology and astrophysics.

With the EMBLA survey using SkyMapper photometry and AAOmega/AAT spectroscopy, we have recently discovered for the first time a large number of extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way bulge, as metal-poor as [Fe/H]=-4.0 (Howes et al. 2014, 2015). Most of these metal-poor bulge stars have tight orbits constrained to the central regions of the Galaxy, convincingly demonstrating that they are not simply halo star interlopers. Both their extremely metal-poor nature and kinematics imply that they are prime candidates for being the oldest known objects in the Universe. Asteroseismology with K2 now offers the unique opportunity to date some of these stars, potentially probing for the first time the z>15 Universe.

We propose to observe with K2 ~380 metal-poor [Fe/H]<-2 bulge giants located within the Campaign 11 footprint to derive asteroseismic information, especially stellar ages. We have already determined reliable spectroscopic parameters (Teff, [Fe/H]) for the targets, facilitating an asteroseismic analysis of these red giant branch stars. Our sample size is driven by the expected asteroseismic age uncertainties of ~20% from K2 data for red giants (Stello et al. 2015, ApJL, 809, L3), which implies a mean statistical age uncertainty for our sample of ~200Myr, i.e. corresponding to differentiating between redshift z=15 and 10. These K2 observations will also allow a direct comparison of average formation redshift of bulge stars and halo stars with the same [Fe/H] which have been observed in previous K2 campaigns, irrespective of possible systematic errors in age determinations for metal-poor stars; the age difference between z=10 (expected for bulge stars) and z=5 (halo) is ~700Myr.
