%B We propose a K2 Program to monitor large, nearby (z < 0.01) galaxies in Campaign 17, 18 and 19. Monitoring of these galaxies will allow us to look for fast (∆t < 10 days) and faint (M > −14) stellar transients. The K2 science mission with its long baseline, high-cadence, power to obtain high precision photometry, and the ability to monitor several targets simultaneously provides a unique opportunity to examine such a broad range of variables and transients.
