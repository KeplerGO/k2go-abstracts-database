%B We propose to continue our K2 project to measure rotation periods and activity diagnostics for bright, nearby M dwarfs from a recent proper motion survey. These data are an essential part of our aim to determine the rotation/activity relation of M dwarfs, which is the key to understanding the fully convective dynamo transition and angular momentum evolution at the low-mass end of the stellar sequence, and to characterize the high-energy environments of habitable zones around M dwarfs.
