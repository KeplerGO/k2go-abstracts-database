%B Due to their outgassing, comets are some of the best samples of the protoplanetary disk material present in the early solar system. This outgassing however presents challenges to characterizing comet nuclei in terms of surface color and rotational period which are utilized to characterize their asteroid siblings. At periods wherein comets appear the brightest, their flux is dominated by gas and dust in the coma, leaving the best observational circumstances for cometary nuclei when these objects are at distances > ~3 AU beyond which sublimation of water ice does not drive the cometary coma.  Lightcurves have been utilized to estimate the limits bulk density and approximate shapes and/or axial ratios of cometary nuclei for only a small handful of the known comet population.  In many cases rotational periods of comets are poorly constrained due to incomplete ground based telescopic data over the fitted period. This results in both errors in estimates of the axial ratios and the rotational periods for the observed comet nuclei.  We propose to utilize K2 to obtain lightcurves for 11 comets in GO-5 to :
* Determine the rotational periods and amplitudes for a sample of comets at heliocentric distances > 3 AU which will be compared to other bodies such as Trojan and Hilda asteroids, as well as Kuiper Belt Objects
* Compare lightcurve periods to those published in the literature for a subsample of short period comets to determine if the rotational period of these cometary nuclei has been altered by outgassing activity Methodology:
We have identified 11 comets to be studied by Kepler in Campaigns 14-16 with magnitudes of m_V < 21. The single observation photometric uncertainty for objects of 21st magnitude observed with the 30 minute cadence of K2 is 0.15 magnitudes, sufficient to identify objects with axis ratios >= 1.15. Two comets within our sample have published rotational periods and have undergone an additional perihelion passage, allowing us to determine if the rotational period has been modified.

Relevance to K2: 
This study will obtain high fidelity lightcurves for solar system objects in the Kepler field of view during campaigns 14-16 to determine if these objects have lightcurve periods and amplitudes common to specific asteroid populations consistent with a common origin in the early solar system. Our sample is only comprised of objects within the K2 fields, and thus does not require any modifications from the reported operational characteristics of the spacecraft during these campaigns.
