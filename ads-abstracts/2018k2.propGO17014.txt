%B The fundamentals of stellar astronomy are built upon studies of nearby stars. Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations, multiplicity, structure, and evolution. These nearby stars have accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes, photometry, multiplicity, metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation rates, we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What stellar parameter(s) of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to be up to three full magnitudes in width? The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters discussed above.

We propose to utilize the K2 mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25 pc to accurately determine their rotation rates and amplitudes as two of the key approaches to solve the width problem. In K2 fields 17, 18 and 19, we will observe 18 nearby systems 1 , including seven K dwarfs and eleven M dwarfs. These stars are the closest K and M dwarfs in these three fields other than those stars overlapped with previous fields. Along with previous nearby stars we proposed in K2, the K2 mission has observed 74 nearest K and M dwarfs. Observing these additional 18 stars and as well as others observed in the upcoming tess mission will not only provide crucial data to understand the width of the MS, but has a opportunity to detect any transiting planet sytem similar to TRAPPIST-1. We expect to have the most complete characterization of a set of the nearest K and M stars in all K2 campaigns that have ever been accomplished.
