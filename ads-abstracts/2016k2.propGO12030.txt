%B Hypervelocity Stars (HVS) move so fast that they are unbound to the
Galaxy. The tidal disruption of a close binary by the supermassive black
hole (SMBH) in the Galactic center was suggested as their origin. Most
of the known HVSs are of late B spectral type. Therefore, their
evolutionary state is still ambigious - either they are distant, massive
(2-4 solar masses) main sequence stars or closer, low mass blue
horizontal branch stars.
To achieve the full 6D phase space information their distances need to
be known accurately. With Kepler light curves it will be possible to
detect the low amplitude, slow variability indicative of a slowly
pulsating main sequence star.
In addition, inconsistencies between time of flight and evolutionary
lifetime occured, which call for ejection scenarios involving triple
systems and mergers. Such a triple could be ejected as a HVS binary
through interactions with the SMBH in the Galactic Center. The discovery
of such a binary could explain the appearence of young stars in the
distant Galactic halo by rejuvenation through merging. But much more
close HVS binaries are predicted to exist than mergers. The K2 mission
will enable us to search for close companions via eclipses, reflection
effects from a cool companion or ellipsoidal deformations of the primary
caused by a white dwarf companion predicted by models of the triple
ejection scenario.
