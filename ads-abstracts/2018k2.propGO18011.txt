%B We propose to re-observe main-sequence cluster (M67 and Praesepe) and field stars targeted in our K2 Campaign 5, 6, and 12 proposals on Statistics of Variability that fall on active pixels in K2 Campaigns 18, 17, and 19. A longer time series including data from two campaigns will improve the signal-to-noise in the Fourier transform of the light curve. Furthermore, many targets proposed for C6 and C12 were actually never observed because of target prioritization. We would like to obtain longer time-series baselines to search for changes in the light curves that could indicate an evolving magnetic stellar cycle, a perturbation in a binary orbital period from a companion planet or star, or amplitude, frequency and phase variations resulting from nonlinear phenomena such as mode coupling in pulsating variables. In addition, we propose to observe several brighter candidate gamma Doradus/delta Scuti and hybrid stars identified in earlier campaigns in short cadence, to search for additional modes, study amplitude variability, and remove the frequency ambiguity caused by the 24.5 cycle/day Nyquist frequency reflections present in long-cadence observations. These target variables have high potential for utility of ground-based follow-up observations for asteroseismic modeling.
