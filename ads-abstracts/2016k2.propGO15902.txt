%B We propose short-cadence observations in K2 Field 15 of three candidate pulsating helium-atmosphere white dwarfs (DBVs), with selection based on their photometric colors from the VST/ATLAS survey. These DDT observations supplement our successful GO proposal to continue observing pulsating white dwarfs with the K2 mission.
