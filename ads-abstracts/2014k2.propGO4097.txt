%B The Kepler science team has identified M dwarfs as a vital set of targets for the K2 mission. While Kepler and K2 have combined to observe nearly 10,000 M dwarfs to date, nearly 85% of these have been M0 and M1 dwarfs. Here, we propose observations of 3,548 mid-M dwarfs, enabling us to extend our knowledge of planet occurrence rates to the most abundant stars in the universe, a class almost entirely unstudied during the primary Kepler mission.
