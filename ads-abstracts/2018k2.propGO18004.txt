%B Campaign 18 is a unique and final opportunity to obtain multi-epoch light curves for nearly 1500 members of the foundational open cluster M67, and to increase the discovery space in S/N and in frequency. With a third campaign, we will be able to increase our frequency resolution and thereby determine internal evolutionary states with asteroseismology; increase surface-gravity precision to test evolutionary models; securely measure rotation periods to test new models of angular momentum evolution and anchor gyrochronology; detect significant short-cadence (SC) oscillation power in subgiants and measure an independent cluster age; increase our chances of detecting super flares at solar age; and increase our discovery space for exoplanets in this solar-age cluster or tighten our limits on exoplanet frequency.
