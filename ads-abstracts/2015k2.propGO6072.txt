%B The stellar content and structure of the Galactic halo constrain star formation at the earliest epochs, and halo mass and assembly. The best remote tracers are K giants, for their high luminosities render them visible to 100 kpc, and their presence in populations of all metallicities and ages ensure an unbiased sample. However, the difficulty of separating distant giants from foreground dwarfs at faint magnitudes has led to choosing preferentially metal-poor giant candidates. Our goal here is to use K2 light curves, which lack this bias, to identify two hundred giants 10  100 kpc above the Galactic plane in lightly-reddened areas at high Galactic latitude.

This proposal is relevant to the Kepler K2 Guest Observer solicitation because new K2 observations are the only means of doing this without invoking an explicit low-metallicity bias. Previous identification relies on spectra or photometric indices to select candidates for scarce follow-up resources; such criteria are vital to increase the odds of finding halo giants. K2 does not need this, as it can identify all cool giants from their light curves, and can record a thousand potential targets at once. Kepler could as well, but the Kepler field was centered at low Galactic latitude, b = +13.5º, a line of sight that remains close to the Galactic plane. Reddening is significant and variable, and halo giants are swamped by dwarfs of the disk/thick disk. Existing K2 data in the high-latitude fields C1 and C3 include very few suitable STAR targets. Obtaining new K2 data in the upcoming K2 high-latitude fields C6, C8, C10, and C12 now offers a unique opportunity to identify a total of a thousand giants lying 10 to 100 kpc above the Galactic plane without explicit color or line-strength cuts based on metallicity.

We propose K2 C6 long-cadence observations of ~1050 distant giant candidates at Galactic latitude b from 48° to 53°, with E(g-r) ~ 0.04. These include all on-silicon EPIC stars with SDSS ugriz photometry, 0.60 <= g-r < 1.06, proximity > 12 if given, and proper motion < 13 mas/yr. These targets all have 16 <~ Kp <~ 18, too faint for direct GAIA or APOGEE spectroscopy. The faint Kp limit, required for peak detection in a giant power spectrum, is based on Kepler light curves of APOGEE metal-poor giants and a K2 precision of 1% in 30min at Kp = 17.5. A check on peak detectability and the resulting parameters comes from C6 targets having SEGUE spectra, namely 16 dwarfs and 15 giants.

The peak frequency nu_max of maximum power of p-mode (solar-like) oscillations scales as gravity g/sqrt(Teff). At 0.56 < (g-r)o < 1.02, such giants have 200 >~ nu_max >~ 1¼Hz and temperature Teff from 5100 to 4200K. As dwarfs show no peaks here (or recognizable ones), and metal-poor subgiants and red clump stars are bluer, nu_max alone can separate giants from interlopers. nu_max will be found to 10% from power spectra derived from the K2 80-day light curves (from the positions of the strongest peaks near the high- frequency cutoff), and Teff to < 100K (from g-r). These will fix the luminosity of a giant to ~20%, and be confirmed via globular- cluster ugriz diagrams and existing results for individual stars. Follow-up spectroscopy of these distant giants (and dwarfs) to improve their parameters need observe but a small sky area, 4 sq deg, accessible to both UVES FLAMES and Keck DEIMOS.

We will publish a catalogue of all stars detected, with our values of nu_max, luminosity, distance, Teff, and log g, plus metallicity [Fe/H] for cooler stars (estimated from ugriz color-color plots). For added value, we will provide a grid of high-resolution spectra calculated from first principles for metal-poor giants. From these, Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] may be derived from optical spectra of moderate or high resolution for metal-poor giants in regions of both low and high reddening. This will provide important standardized input for K2/Kepler metal-poor giant seismology and other NASA investigations.
