%B We propose to obtain precision pulsation properties of 138 bulge RR Lyrae variables (RRLs), a population of RRLs with the widest metallicity distribution in the Galaxy and a population consisting of double-mode stars with characteristics unlike anywhere else in the Milky Way. From spectroscopically surveying ~1000 bulge RRLs, we have found this population has an abundance distribution spanning three orders of magnitude, suggestive of multiple populations within the bulge RRL, which have also been identified by two RRL sequences in the period-amplitude (Bailey) diagram. Our observations have also indicated that the homogeneous population of double-mode RRLs (RR01 stars) found within 10 deg in the bulge, that was previously explained as stars with a common origin (i.e., remnant from a disrupted dwarf galaxy or stellar cluster), in fact do not have similar dynamics. Therefore their “clumping” in the RR01 period ratio regime needs to be understood in a different, yet unknown manner. With K2, we can undertake a more detailed investigation of the bulge RRLs by obtaining precise periods, amplitudes and magnitudes. These will allow exquisite measurements of the Bailey diagram to trace multiple populations that exist within this old population. The exact RR01 pulsation properties will also open up the possibility to advance the theory of RRL pulsation, as models of RR01 metallicities and masses can be applied and tested on the bulge RR01 stars, a population occupying a unique (more metal-rich) RR01 period ratio regime.
