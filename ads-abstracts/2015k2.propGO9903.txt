%B Blue supergiant (BSG) stars are scarce, evolved stars with massive progenitors (M >= 3 M_x005F_x005Fsol) at birth time. If more massive than ∼9 M_x005F_x005Fsol, they are destined to undergo a core-collapse supernova. Moderate to rapid rotation, binarity and line-driven mass loss are their three key features. Once hydrogen is depleted in the core of massive stars, they evolve towards the Red Supergiant (RSG) phase on the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale – which is ∼1 000 times shorter than the nuclear timescale. Thus, the chance of finding BSGs inside the Hertzsprung gap is quite slim: Once found, the opportunity ought be seized!

Since BSGs reside in the Galactic disk, high-precision space photometry of BSGs is uniquely possible during K2 campaigns 9 and 11. For field 9, 38 BSGs fall on the silicon. Based on Simbad, they belong to luminosity classes Ia, Ib, II, and III, with spectral types ranging from B0 to B9, and magnitude 8 ≤ V ≤ 12. Pulsation periods in BSGs roughly range from half-a-day to weeks; thus, the long-cadence 3-month K2 photometry is crucial to obtain ∼0.01/d frequency resolution, needed for robust frequency analysis.

For the proposed targets brighter than ∼9th magnitude, we guarantee simultaneous ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up with the HERMES (R ∼ 85 000, Mercator Telescope, La Palma, 1.2 m) and HIDES (R ∼ 65 000, OAO, Okayama, 1.9 m) spectrographs. Fainter targets (9 < V ≤ 12) will be also monitored, but with lower cadence during the whole campaign. The spectra will be used for a thorough spectroscopic analysis (extracting detailed abundances, Teff, log g, v sin i, vmacro, Mdot, and v∞), in addition to radial velocity variability (due to binarity), line profile variability (due to pulsations and/or spots), and Hα/Hβ line variability (due to possible episodic mass loss).

The combined spectroscopy and K2 photometry will be used to (a) identify or exclude pulsation variability, (b) draw the observational instability strips, and confront that with our predictions (Moravveji 2016) (c) explore the pulsation excitation mechanism (epsilon- versus κ-mechanism). (d) carry out iterative frequency prewhitening, and search for regularities in frequency and/or periods, (e) characterize possible rotating spots, (f) test the hypothesis that macroturbulence velocity has pulsation origin, (g) trace the surface chemical and rotational velocity evolution, with a possible link to rotational and/or non-rotational mixing processes, and (h) disentangle apparent single stars versus close binaries.
